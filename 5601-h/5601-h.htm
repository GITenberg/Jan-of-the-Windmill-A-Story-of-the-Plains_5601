WIFE.&mdash;STRANGERS.&mdash;TEN SHILLINGS A WEEK.&mdash;THE
LITTLE JAN.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Storm</span> without and within!</p>
<p>So the windmiller might have said, if he had been in the habit
of putting his thoughts into an epigrammatic form, as a groan
from his wife and a growl of thunder broke simultaneously upon
his ear, whilst the rain fell scarcely faster than her tears.</p>
<p>It was far from mending matters that both storms were equally
unexpected.&nbsp; For eight full years the miller&rsquo;s wife
had been the meekest of women.&nbsp; If there was a firm (and
yet, as he flattered himself, a just) husband in all the dreary
straggling district, the miller was that man.&nbsp; And he always
did justice to his wife&rsquo;s good qualities,&mdash;at least to
her good quality of submission,&mdash;and would, till lately,
have upheld her before any one as a model of domestic
obedience.&nbsp; From the day when he brought home his bride,
tall, pretty, and perpetually smiling, to the tall old mill and
the ugly old mother who never smiled at all, there had been but
one will in the household.&nbsp; At any rate, after the old
woman&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; For during her life-time her stern son
paid her such deference that it was a moot point, perhaps, which
of them really ruled.&nbsp; Between them, however, the young wife
was moulded to a nicety, and her voice gained no more weight in
the counsels of the windmill when the harsh tones of the
mother-in-law were silenced for ever.</p>
<p>The miller was one of those good souls who live by the light
of a few small shrewdities (often proverbial), and pique
themselves on sticking to them to such a point, as if it were the
greater virtue to abide by a narrow rule the less it
applied.&nbsp; The kernel of his domestic theory was,
&ldquo;Never yield, and you never will have to,&rdquo; and to
this he was proud of having stuck against all temptations from a
real, though hard, affection for his own; and now, after working
so smoothly for eight years, had it come to this?</p>
<p>The miller scratched his bead, and looked at his wife, almost
with amazement.&nbsp; She moaned, though he bade her be silent;
she wept, in spite of words which had hitherto been an effectual
styptic to her tears; and she met the commonplaces of his common
sense with such wild, miserable laughter, that he shuddered as he
heard her.</p>
<p>Weakness in human beings is like the strength of beasts, a
power of which fortunately they are not always conscious.&nbsp;
Unless positively brutal, you cannot well beat a sickly woman for
wailing and weeping; and if she will not cease for any lesser
consideration, there seems nothing for an unbending husband to do
but to leave her to herself.</p>
<p>This the miller had to do, anyhow.&nbsp; For he could only
spare a moment&rsquo;s attention to her now and then, since the
mill required all his care.</p>
<p>In a coat and hat of painted canvas, he had been in and out
ever since the storm began; now directing the two men who were
working within, now struggling along the stage that ran outside
the windmill, at no small risk of being fairly blown away.</p>
<p>He had reefed the sails twice already in the teeth of the
blinding rain.&nbsp; But he did well to be careful.&nbsp; For it
was in such a storm as this, five years ago &ldquo;come
Michaelmas,&rdquo; that the worst of windmill calamities had
befallen him,&mdash;the sails had been torn off his mill and
dashed into a hundred fragments upon the ground.&nbsp; And such a
mishap to a seventy feet tower mill means&mdash;as windmillers
well know&mdash;not only a stoppage of trade, but an expense of
two hundred pounds for the new sails.</p>
<p>Many a sack of grist, which should have come to him had gone
down to the watermill in the valley before the new sails were at
work; and the huge debt incurred to pay for them was not fairly
wiped out yet.&nbsp; That catastrophe had kept the windmiller a
poor man for five years, and it gave him a nervous dread of
storms.</p>
<p>And talking of storms, here was another unreasonable
thing.&nbsp; The morning sky had been (like the miller&rsquo;s
wedded life) without a cloud.&nbsp; The day had been sultry, for
the time of year unseasonably so.&nbsp; And, just when the miller
most grudged an idle day, when times were hard, when he was in
debt,&mdash;for some small matters, as well as the sail
business,&mdash;and when, for the first time in his life, he felt
almost afraid of his own hearthstone, and would fain have been
busy at his trade, not a breath of wind had there been to turn
the sails of the mill.&nbsp; Not a waft to cool his perplexed
forehead, not breeze enough to stir the short grass that glared
for miles over country flat enough to mock him with the fullest
possible view of the cloudless sky.&nbsp; Then towards evening, a
few gray flecks had stolen up from the horizon like thieves in
the dusk, and a mighty host of clouds had followed them; and when
the wind did come, it came in no moderate measure, but brought
this awful storm upon its wings, which now raged as if all the
powers of mischief had got loose, and were bent on turning every
thing topsy-turvy indoors and out.</p>
<p>What made the winds and clouds so perverse, the clerk of the
weather best knows; but there was a reason for the
unreasonableness of the windmiller&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>She had lost her child, her youngest born, and therefore, at
present, her best beloved.&nbsp; This girl-babe was the sixth of
the windmiller and his wife&rsquo;s children, the last that God
gave them, and the first that it had pleased Him to take
away.</p>
<p>The mother had been weak herself at the time that the baby
fell ill, and unusually ill-fitted to bear a heavy blow.&nbsp;
Then her watchful eyes had seen symptoms of ailing in the child
long before the windmiller&rsquo;s good sense would allow a fuss
to be made, and expense to be incurred about a little peevishness
up or down.&nbsp; And it was some words muttered by the doctor
when he did come, about not having been sent for soon enough,
which were now doing as much as any thing to drive the poor woman
frantic.&nbsp; They struck a blow, too, at her blind belief in
the miller&rsquo;s invariable wisdom.&nbsp; If he had but
listened to her in this matter, were it only for love&rsquo;s
sake!&nbsp; There was something, she thought, in what that woman
had said who came to help her with the last offices,&mdash;the
miller discouraged &ldquo;neighbors,&rdquo; but this was a matter
of decency,&mdash;that it was as foolish for a man to have the
say over babies and housework as it would be for his wife to want
her word in the workshop or the mill.</p>
<p>Perhaps a state of subjection for grown-up people does not
tend to make them reasonable, especially in their
indignations.&nbsp; The windmiller&rsquo;s wife dared not, for
her life, have told him in so many words that she thought it
would be for their joint benefit if he would give a little more
consideration to her wishes and opinions; but from this
suppressed idea came many sharp and peevish words at this time,
which, apart from their true source, were quite as unreasonable
and perverse as the miller held them to be.&nbsp; Nor is being
completely under the control of another, self-control.&nbsp; It
may be doubted if it can even do much to teach it.&nbsp; The
thread of her passive condition having been, for the time, broken
by grief, the bereaved mother moaned and wailed, and rocked
herself, and beat her breast, and turned fiercely upon all
interference, like some poor beast in anguish.</p>
<p>She had clung to her children with an almost morbid
tenderness, in proportion as she found her worthy husband stern
and cold.&nbsp; A hard husband sometimes makes a soft mother, and
it is perhaps upon the baby of the family that her repressed
affections outpoured themselves most fully.&nbsp; It was so in
this case, at any rate.&nbsp; And the little one had that
unearthly beauty which is seen, or imagined, about children who
die young.&nbsp; And the poor woman had suffered and striven so
for it, to have it and to keep it.&nbsp; The more critical grew
its illness, the intenser grew her strength and resolution by
watchfulness, by every means her instinct and experience could
suggest, to fight and win the battle against death.&nbsp; And
when all was vain, the maddening thought tortured her that it
might have been saved.</p>
<p>The miller had made a mistake, and it was a pity that he made
another on the top of it, with the best intentions.&nbsp; He
hurried on the funeral, hoping that when &ldquo;all was
over&rdquo; the mother would &ldquo;settle down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was this crowning insult to her agony, the shortening
of the too brief time when she could watch by all that remained
to her of her child, which drove her completely wild.&nbsp; She
reproached him now plainly and bitterly enough.&nbsp; She would
neither listen to reason nor obey; and when&mdash;with more truth
than taste&mdash;he observed that other people lost children, and
that they had plenty left, she laughed in his face that wild
laugh which drove him back to the mill and to the storm.</p>
<p>How it raged!&nbsp; The miller&rsquo;s wife was an uneducated,
commonplace woman enough, but, in the excited state of her
nervous system, she was as sensible as any poet of a kind of
comforting harmony in the wild sounds without; though at another
time they would have frightened her.</p>
<p>They did not disturb the children, who were in bed.&nbsp; Four
in the old press-bed in the corner, and one in a battered crib,
and one in the narrow bed over which the coverlet was not yet
green.</p>
<p>The day&rsquo;s work was over for her, though it was only just
beginning for the miller, and the mother had nothing to do but
weep, and her tears fell and fell, and the rain poured and
poured.&nbsp; That last outburst had somewhat relieved her, and
she almost wished her husband would come back, as a flash of
lightning dazzled her eyes, and the thunder rattled round the old
mill, as if the sails had broken up again, and were falling upon
the roof of the round-house.&nbsp; All her senses were acute
to-night, and she listened for the miller&rsquo;s footsteps, and
so, listening, in the lull after the thunder, she heard another
sound.&nbsp; Wheels upon the road.</p>
<p>A pang shot through her heart.&nbsp; Thus had the
doctor&rsquo;s gig sounded the night he came,&mdash;alas, too
late!&nbsp; How long and how intensely she had listened for
that!&nbsp; She first heard it just beyond the mile-stone.&nbsp;
This one must be a good bit on this side of it; up the hill, in
fact.&nbsp; She could not help listening.&nbsp; It was so like,
so terribly like!&nbsp; Now it spun along the level ground.&nbsp;
Ah, the doctor had not hurried so!&nbsp; Now it was at the mill,
at the door, and&mdash;it stopped.</p>
<p>The miller&rsquo;s wife rose to run out, she hardly knew
why.&nbsp; But in a moment she checked herself, and went back to
her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be crazed, surely,&rdquo; said the poor woman,
sitting down again.&nbsp; &ldquo;There be more gigs than one in
the world, and folk often stops to ask their way of the
maester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These travellers were a long time about the putting of such a
simple question, especially as the night was not a pleasant one
to linger out in.&nbsp; The murmur of voices, too, which the
woman overheard, betokened a close conversation, in which the
familiar drawl of the windmiller&rsquo;s dialect blended audibly
with that kind of clean-clipt speaking peculiar to
gentlefolk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ve been talking to master&rsquo;s five minute
an&rsquo; more,&rdquo; muttered the miller&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What can &rsquo;ee want with un?&rdquo;&nbsp; The talking
ceased as she spoke, and the windmiller appeared, followed by a
woman carrying a young baby in her arms.</p>
<p>He was a ruddy man for his age at any time, but there was an
extra flush on his cheeks just now, and some excitement in his
manner, making him look as his wife was not wont to see him more
than once a year, after the Foresters&rsquo; dinner at the Heart
of Oak.&nbsp; There was a difference, too.&nbsp; A little too
much drink made the windmiller peevish and pompous, but just now
he spoke in a kindly, almost conciliating tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, missus!&nbsp; Let this good lady dry herself a
bit, and get warm, and the little un too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A woman&mdash;ill-favored, though there was no positive fault
to be found with her features, except that the upper lip was long
and cleft, and the lower one very large&mdash;came forward with
the child, and began to take off its wraps, and the
miller&rsquo;s wife, giving her face a hasty wipe, went
hospitably to help her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tst! tst! little love!&rdquo; she cried, gulping down a
sob, due to her own sad memories, and moving the cloak more
tenderly than the woman in whose arms the child lay.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a pair of dark eyes, then!&nbsp; Is&rsquo;t a boy or
girl, m&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy,&rdquo; said a voice from the door, and the
miller&rsquo;s wife, with a suppressed shriek of timidity, became
aware of a man whose entrance she had not perceived, and to whom
she dropped a hasty courtesy.</p>
<p>He was a man slightly above the middle height, whose
slenderness made him seem taller.&nbsp; An old cloak, intended as
much to disguise as to protect him, did not quite conceal a
faultlessness of costume beneath it, after the fashion of the
day.&nbsp; Waistcoats of three kinds, one within the other, a
frilled shirt, and a well-adjusted stock, were to be seen, though
he held the ends of the old cloak tightly across him, as the wind
would have caught them in the doorway.&nbsp; He wore a
countryman&rsquo;s hat, which seemed to suit him as little as the
cloak, and from beneath the brim his dark eyes glared with a
restless, dissatisfied look, and were so dark and so fierce and
bright that one could hardly see any other details of his face,
unless it were his smooth chin, which, either from habit or from
the stiffness of his stock, he carried strangely up in the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; said the windmiller&rsquo;s wife,
courtesying, and setting a chair, with her eyes wandering back by
a kind of fascination to those of the stranger; &ldquo;be pleased
to take a seat, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger sat down for a moment, and then stood up
again.&nbsp; Then he seemed to remember that he still wore his
hat, and removed it, holding it stiffly before him in his gloved
hands.&nbsp; This displayed a high, narrow head, on which the
natural hair was worn short and without parting, and a face
which, though worn, was not old.&nbsp; And, for no definable
reason, an impression stole over the windmiller&rsquo;s wife that
he, like her husband, had some wish to conciliate, which in his
case struggled hard with a very different kind of feeling, more
natural to him.</p>
<p>Then he took out a watch of what would now be called the old
turnip shape, and said impatiently to the miller, &ldquo;Our time
is short, my good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, sir,&rdquo; said the windmiller.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Missus! a word with you here.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he led the
way into the round-house, where his wife followed,
wondering.&nbsp; Her wonder was not lessened when he laid his
hand upon her shoulder, and, with flushed cheek and a tone of
excitement that once more recalled the Foresters&rsquo; annual
meeting, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had some sore times, missus, of
late, but good luck have come our way to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how then, maester?&rdquo; faltered his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That child,&rdquo; said the windmiller, turning his
broad thumb expressively towards the inner room, &ldquo;belongs
to folk that want to get a home for un, and can afford to pay for
un, too.&nbsp; And the place being healthy and out of the way,
and having heard of our trouble, and you just bereaved of a
little un&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! no!&rdquo; shrieked the poor mother, who now
understood all.&nbsp; &ldquo;I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>, maester,
&rsquo;tis unpossible, I could <i>not</i>.&nbsp; Oh dear! oh
dear! isn&rsquo;t it bad enough to lose the sweetest child that
ever saw light, without taking in an outcast to fill that dear
angel&rsquo;s place?&nbsp; Oh dear! oh dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we behindhand in more quarters than one,&rdquo;
continued the miller, prudently ignoring his wife&rsquo;s tears
and remonstrances, &ldquo;and a dear season coming on, and an
uncertain trade that keeps a man idle by days together, and
here&rsquo;s ten shillings a week dropped into our laps, so to
speak.&nbsp; Ten shillings a week&mdash;regular and sartin.&nbsp;
No less now, and no more hereafter, the governor said.&nbsp; Them
were his words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s ten shilling a week to me, and my child
dead and gone?&rdquo; moaned the mother, in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s ten shillings a week to you</i>?&rdquo;
cried the windmiller, who was fairly exasperated, in tones so
loud that they were audible in the dwelling room, where the
stranger, standing by the three-legged table, stroked his lips
twice or thrice with his hand, as if to smooth out a cynical
smile which strove to disturb their decorous and somewhat haughty
compression.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s ten shilling a week to
you?&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s food to you, and drink to you, and
firing to you, and boots for the children&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp;
Look here, my woman.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve had a sore affliction,
but that&rsquo;s not to say you&rsquo;re to throw good luck in
the dirt for a whimsey.&nbsp; This matter&rsquo;s
settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the miller strode back into the inner room, whilst his
wife sat upon a sack of barley, wringing her hands, and moaning,
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do my duty by un, maester, I
couldn&rsquo;t do my duty by un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This she repeated at intervals, with her apron over her face,
as before; and then, suddenly aware that her husband had left
her, she hurried into the inner room to plead her own
cause.&nbsp; It was too late.&nbsp; The strangers had gone.&nbsp;
The miller was not there, and the baby lay on the end of the
press bedstead, wailing as bitterly as the mother herself.</p>
<p>It had been placed there, with a big bundle of clothes by it,
before the miller came back, and he had found it so.&nbsp; He
found the stranger too, with his hat on his head, and his cloak
fastened, glancing from time to time at the child, and then
withdrawing his glance hastily, and looking forcedly round at the
meagre furnishing of the miller&rsquo;s room, and then back at
the little bundle on the bed, and away again.&nbsp; The woman
stood with her back to the press-bed, her striped shawl drawn
tightly round her, and her hands folded together as closely as
her long lip pressed the heavy one below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it settled?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, sir,&rdquo; said the miller.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse my missus being as she is, but
it&rsquo;s fretting for the child we&rsquo;ve a
lost&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, I understand,&rdquo; said the stranger,
hastily.&nbsp; He was pulling back the rings of a silk netted
purse, which he had drawn mechanically from his pocket, and
which, from some sudden start of his, fell chinking on to the
floor.&nbsp; Whatever the thought was which startled him, he
thought it so sharply that he looked up in fear that he had said
it aloud.&nbsp; But he had not spoken, and the miller had no
other expression than that of an eager satisfaction on his face
as the stranger counted out the gold by the flaring light of the
tallow candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarter&rsquo;s pay in advance,&rdquo; he said
briefly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be paid quarterly, you
understand.&rdquo;&nbsp; After which, and checking himself in a
look towards the child, he went out, followed by the woman.</p>
<p>In the round-house he paused however, and looked back into the
meagre, dimly lighted room, where the little bundle upon the bed
lay weeping.&nbsp; For a moment, a storm of irresolution seemed
to seize him, and then muttering, &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped
for the present, it can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; he hurried
towards the vehicle, in the back seat of which the woman was
already seated.</p>
<p>The driver touched his hat to him as he approached, and turned
the cushion, which he had been protecting from the rain.&nbsp;
The stranger stumbled over the cloak as he got in, and, cursing
the step, bade the man drive like something which had no
connection with driving.&nbsp; But, as they turned, the
windmiller ran out and after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, sir!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what now?&rdquo; said the stranger, sharply, as
the horse was pulled back on his haunches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it named?&rdquo; gasped the miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, all that sort of thing,&rdquo; was the
impatient reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what name?&rdquo; asked the miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan.&nbsp; J, A, N,&rdquo; said the stranger, shouting
against the blustering wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;the other name?&rdquo; said the
windmiller, who was now standing close to the stranger&rsquo;s
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is yours?&rdquo; he asked, with a sharp look of
his dark eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lake&mdash;Abel,&rdquo; said the windmiller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is his also, henceforth,&rdquo; said the stranger,
waving his hand, as if to close the subject,&mdash;&ldquo;Jan
Lake.&nbsp; Drive on, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse started forward, and they whirled away down the wet,
gray road.&nbsp; And before the miller had regained his mill, the
carriage was a distant speck upon the storm.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE MILLER&rsquo;S
CALCULATIONS.&mdash;HIS HOPES AND FEARS.&mdash;THE
NURSE-BOY.&mdash;CALM.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> windmiller went back to his
work.&nbsp; He had risked something over this business in leaving
the mill in the hands of others, even for so short a time.&nbsp;
Then the storm abated somewhat.&nbsp; The wind went round, and
blew with less violence a fine steady breeze.&nbsp; The miller
began to think of going into the dwelling-room for a bit of
supper to carry him through his night&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; And yet
he lingered about returning to his wife in her present mood.</p>
<p>He stuck the sharp point of his windmiller&rsquo;s candlestick
<a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a> into a sack that stood near, and
drawing up a yellow canvas &ldquo;sample bag&rdquo;&mdash;which
served him as a purse&mdash;from the depths of his pocket, he
began to count the coins by the light of the candle.&nbsp; He
counted them over several times with increasing satisfaction, and
made several slow but sure calculations as to the sum of ten
shillings a week by the month, the quarter, the half, and the
whole year.&nbsp; He then began another set of calculations of a
kind less pleasant, especially to an honest man,&mdash;his
debts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good bit to the doctor for both
times,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s the coffin,
and something at the Heart of Oak for the bearers, and a couple
of bottles red wine there, too, for the missus, when she were so
bad.&nbsp; And both the boys had new shoes to follow
in,&mdash;she would have it they should
follow&rdquo;&mdash;&nbsp; And so on, and so on, the windmiller
ran up the list of his petty debts, and saw his way to paying
them.&nbsp; Then he put the money back into the sample bag, and
folded it very neatly, and stowed it away.&nbsp; And then he drew
near the inner door, and peeped into the room.</p>
<p>His poor wife seemed to be in no better case than
before.&nbsp; She sat on the old rocking-chair, swinging
backwards and forwards, and beating her hands upon her knees in
silence, and making no movement to comfort the wailing little
creature on the bed.</p>
<p>For the first time there came upon the windmiller a sense of
the fact that it is an uncertain and a rather dangerous game to
drive a desperate woman into a corner.&nbsp; His missus was as
soft-hearted a soul as ever lived, and for her to sit unmoved by
the weeping of a neglected child was a proof that something was
very far wrong indeed.&nbsp; One or two nasty stories of what
tender-hearted women had done when &ldquo;crazed&rdquo; by grief
haunted him.&nbsp; The gold seemed to grow hot at the bottom of
his pocket.&nbsp; He wished he had got at the stranger&rsquo;s
name and address, in case it should be desirable to annul the
bargain.&nbsp; He wished the missus would cry again, that silence
was worse than any thing.&nbsp; He wished it did not just happen
to come into his head that her grandmother went &ldquo;melancholy
mad&rdquo; when she was left a young widow, and that she had had
an uncle in business who died of softening of the brain.</p>
<p>He wished she would move across the room and take up the
child, with an intensity that almost amounted to prayer.&nbsp;
And, in the votive spirit which generally comes with such
moments, he mentally resolved that, if his missus would but
&ldquo;take to&rdquo; the infant, he would humor her on all other
points just now to the best of his power.</p>
<p>A strange fulfilment often treads on the heels of such
vows.&nbsp; At this moment the wailing of the baby disturbed the
miller&rsquo;s eldest son as he lay in the press-bed.&nbsp; He
was only seven years old, but he had been nurse-boy to his dead
sister during the brief period of her health,&mdash;the more
exclusively so, that the miller&rsquo;s wife was then
weakly,&mdash;and had watched by her sick cradle with a grief
scarcely less than that of the mother.&nbsp; He now crept out and
down the coverlet to the wailing heap of clothes, with a bright,
puzzled look on his chubby face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;mother!&nbsp; Is the
little un come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not
our&rsquo;n.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s another
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the Lord sent us another?&rdquo; said the boy,
lifting the peak of the little hood from the baby&rsquo;s eye,
into which it was hanging, and then fairly gathering the tiny
creature, by a great effort, into his arms, with the daring of a
child accustomed to playing nurse to one nearly as heavy as
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do be glad of that, mother.&nbsp; The
Lord sent the other one in the night, too, mother; that night we
slept in the round-house.&nbsp; Do &rsquo;ee mind?&nbsp; Whishty,
whishty, love!&nbsp; Eh, mother, what eyes!&nbsp; Whishty,
whishty, then!&nbsp; <i>I&rsquo;m</i> seeing to thee, I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something like a sob in the miller&rsquo;s own
throat, but his wife rose, and, running to the bed, fell on her
knees, and with such a burst of weeping as is the thaw of bitter
grief gathered her eldest child and the little outcast together
to her bosom.</p>
<p>At this moment another head was poked up from the bedclothes,
and the second child began to say its say, hoping, perhaps,
thereby to get a share of attention and kisses as well as the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seed a lady and genle&rsquo;m,&rdquo; it broke forth,
&ldquo;and was feared of un.&nbsp; They was going out of
doors.&nbsp; The genle&rsquo;m look back at us, but the lady went
right on.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo; see her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matters were now in a domestic and straightforward condition,
and the windmiller no longer hesitated to come in.&nbsp; But he
was less disposed to a hard and triumphant self-satisfaction than
was common with him when his will ended well.&nbsp; A poor and
unsuccessful career had, indeed, something to do with the
hardness of his nature, and in this flush of prosperity he felt
softened, and resolved inwardly to &ldquo;let the missus take her
time,&rdquo; and come back to her ordinary condition without
interference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall un have a bit of supper, missus?&rdquo; was his
cheerful greeting on coming in.&nbsp; &ldquo;But take your
time,&rdquo; he added, seeing her busy with the baby, &ldquo;take
your time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By-and-by the nurse-boy took the child, and the woman bustled
about the supper.&nbsp; She was still but half reconciled, and
slapped the plates on to the table with a very uncommon
irritability.</p>
<p>The windmiller ate a hearty supper and washed it well down
with home-made ale, under the satisfactory feeling that he could
pay for more when he wanted it.&nbsp; And as he began to plug his
pipe with tobacco, and his wife rocked the new-comer at her
breast, he said thoughtfully,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do &rsquo;ee think, missus, that woman &rsquo;ud be the
mother of un?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried his wife, scornfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ve never been a mother, maester; of this nor any
other one.&nbsp; To see her handle it was enough for me.&nbsp;
The boy himself could see she never so much as looked back at
un.&nbsp; To bring an infant out a night like this, too, and
leave it with strangers.&nbsp; Mother, indeed, says
he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your time, missus, take your time!&rdquo; murmured
the miller in his head.&nbsp; He did not speak aloud, he only
puffed his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose the genle&rsquo;m be the father,
missus?&rdquo; he suggested, as he rose to go back to his
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said his wife, briefly; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t speak one way or another to the feelings of
men-folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This blow was hit straight out, but the windmiller forbore
reply.&nbsp; He was not altogether ill-pleased by it, for the
woman&rsquo;s unwonted peevishness broke down in new tears over
the child, whom she bore away to bed, pouring forth over it half
inarticulate indignation against its unnatural parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ve a soft heart, have the missus,&rdquo; said
the windmiller, thoughtfully, as he went to the outer door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in doubts if she won&rsquo;t take to it more
than her own yet.&nbsp; But she shall have her own
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The storm had passed.&nbsp; The wolds lay glistening and
dreary under a watery sky, but all was still.&nbsp; The
windmiller looked upwards mechanically.&nbsp; To be weatherwise
was part of his trade.&nbsp; But his thoughts were not in the
clouds to-night.&nbsp; He brought the sample bag, without
thinking of it, to the surface of his pocket, and dropped it
slowly back again, murmuring, &ldquo;Ten shilling a
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as he turned again to his night&rsquo;s work he added,
with a nod of complete conviction, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
more&rsquo;n keep <i>he</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE WINDMILLER&rsquo;S
WORDS COME TRUE.&mdash;THE RED SHAWL.&mdash;IN THE
CLOUDS.&mdash;NURSING V. PIG-MINDING.&mdash;THE
ROUND-HOUSE.&mdash;THE MILLER&rsquo;S THUMB.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Strange</span> to say, the
windmiller&rsquo;s idea came true in time,&mdash;the foster-child
was the favorite.</p>
<p>He was the youngest of the family, for the mother had no more
children.&nbsp; This goes for something.</p>
<p>Then, when she had once got over her repugnance to adopting
him, he did do much to heal the old grief, and to fill the empty
place in her heart as well as in the cradle.</p>
<p>He was a frail, fretful little creature, with a very red face
just fading into yellow, about as much golden down on his little
pate as would furnish a moth with plumage, and eyes like
sloe-berries.&nbsp; It was fortunate rather than otherwise that
he was so ailing for some weeks that the good wife&rsquo;s
anxieties came over again, and, in the triumph of being this time
successful, much of the bitterness of the old loss passed
away.</p>
<p>In a month&rsquo;s time he looked healthy, if not absolutely
handsome.&nbsp; The windmiller&rsquo;s wife, indeed, protested
that he was lovely, and she never wearied of marvelling at the
unnatural conduct of those who had found it in their hearts to
intrust so sweet a child to the care of strangers; though it must
be confessed that nothing would have pleased her less than the
arrival of two doting and conscientious parents to reclaim
him.</p>
<p>Indeed, pity had much to do with the large measure of love
that she gave to the deserted child.&nbsp; A meaner sentiment,
too, was not quite without its influence in the predominance
which he gradually gained over his foster brothers and
sisters.&nbsp; There was little enough to be proud of in all that
could be guessed as to his parentage (the windmiller knew
nothing), but there was scope for any amount of fancy; and if the
child displayed any better manners or talents than the other
children, Mrs. Lake would purse her lips, and say, with a
somewhat shabby pride,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody may see &rsquo;tis gentry born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking,&rdquo; said the windmiller,
one day, &ldquo;that if that there woman weren&rsquo;t the
mother, &rsquo;tis likely the mother&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis likely, too,&rdquo; said his wife; and her
kindness abounded the more towards the motherless child.&nbsp;
Little Abel was nurse-boy to it, as he had been to his
sister.&nbsp; Not much more than a baby himself, he would wrap an
old shawl round the baby who was quite a baby, stagger carefully
out at the door, and drop dexterously&mdash;baby
uppermost&mdash;on to the short, dry grass that lay for miles
about the mill.</p>
<p>The shawl was a special shawl, though old.&nbsp; It was red,
and the bright color seemed to take the child&rsquo;s fancy; he
was never so good as when playing upon the gay old rag.&nbsp; His
black eyes would sparkle, and his tiny fingers clutch at it, when
the mother put it about him as he swayed in Abel&rsquo;s
courageous grasp.&nbsp; And then Abel would spread it for him,
like an eastern prayer carpet, under the shadow of the old
mill.</p>
<p>Little need had he of any medicine, when the fresh strong air
that blew about the downs was filling his little lungs for most
of the day.&nbsp; Little did he want toys, as he lay on his red
shawl gazing upwards hour by hour, with Abel to point out every
change in their vast field of view.</p>
<p>It is a part of a windmiller&rsquo;s trade to study the
heavens, and Abel may have inherited a taste for looking
skywards.&nbsp; Then, on these great open downs there is so much
sky to be seen, you can hardly help seeing it, and there is not
much else to look at.&nbsp; Had they lived in a village street,
or even a lane, Abel and his charge might have taken to other
amusements,&mdash;to games, to grubbing in hedges, or amid the
endless treasures of ditches.&nbsp; But as it was, they lay hour
after hour and looked at the sky, as at an open picture-book with
ever-changing leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee here!&rdquo; the nurse-boy would
cry.&nbsp; &ldquo;See to the crows, the pretty black crows!&nbsp;
Eh, there be a lapwing!&nbsp; Lap-py, lap-py, lap-py, there he
go!&nbsp; Janny catch un!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p22b.jpg">
<img alt=
"&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee here!&rdquo; the nurse-boy would cry"
title=
"&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee here!&rdquo; the nurse-boy would cry"
 src="images/p22s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And the baby would stretch his arms responsive to Abel&rsquo;s
expressive signs, and cry aloud for the vanishing bird.</p>
<p>If no living creature crossed the ether, there were the
clouds.&nbsp; Sometimes a long triangular mass of small white
fleecy clouds would stretch across half the heavens, having its
shortest side upon the horizon, and its point at the zenith,
where one white fleece seemed to be leading a gradually widening
flock across the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See then!&rdquo; the nurse-boy would cry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See to the pretty sheep up yonder!&nbsp; Janny mind
un!&nbsp; So! so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if some small gray scud, floating lower, ran past the
far-away cirrus, Abel would add with a quaint seriousness,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the sheep-dog.&nbsp; How he runs then!&nbsp;
Bow-wow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At sunset such a flock wore golden fleeces, and to them, and
to the crimson hues about them, the little Jan stretched his
fingers, and crowed, as if he would have clutched the western sky
as he clutched his own red shawl.</p>
<p>But Abel was better pleased when, in the dusk, the flock
became dark gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be Master Salter&rsquo;s pigs now,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; For pigs in Abel&rsquo;s native place were both
plentiful and black; and he had herded Master Salter&rsquo;s
flock (five and twenty black, and three spotted) for a whole
month before his services were required as nurse-boy to his
sister.</p>
<p>But for the coming of the new baby, he would probably have
gone back to the pigs.&nbsp; And he preferred babies.&nbsp; A
baby demands attention as well as a herd of pigs, but you can get
it home.&nbsp; It does not run off in twenty-eight different
directions, just when you think you have safely turned the corner
into the village.</p>
<p>Master Salter&rsquo;s swine suffered neglect at the hands of
several successors to the office Abel had held, and Master
Salter&mdash;whilst alluding to these in indignant terms as
&ldquo;young varments,&rdquo; &ldquo;gallus-birds,&rdquo; and so
forth&mdash;was pleased to express his regret that the gentle and
trustworthy Abel had given up pig-minding for nursing.</p>
<p>The pigs&rsquo; loss was the baby&rsquo;s gain.&nbsp; No
tenderer or more careful nurse could the little Jan have
had.&nbsp; And he throve apace.</p>
<p>The windmiller took more notice of him than he had been wont
to do of his own children in their babyhood.&nbsp; He had never
been a playful or indulgent father, but he now watched with
considerable interest the child who, all unconsciously, was
bringing in so much &ldquo;grist to the mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the weather was not fine enough for them to be out of
doors, Abel would play with his charge in the round-house, and
the windmiller never drove him out of the mill, as at one time he
would have done.&nbsp; Now and then, too, he would pat the little
Jan&rsquo;s head, and bestow a word of praise on his careful
guardian.</p>
<p>It may be well, by-the-by, to explain what a round-house
is.&nbsp; Some of the brick or tower mills widen gradually and
evenly to the base.&nbsp; Others widen abruptly at the lowest
story, which stands out all round at the bottom of the mill, and
has a roof running all round too.&nbsp; The projection is, in
fact, an additional passage, encircling the bottom story of the
windmill.&nbsp; It is the round-house.&nbsp; If you take a
pill-box to represent the basement floor of a tower-mill, and
then put another pill-box two or three sizes larger over it, you
have got the circular passage between the two boxes, and have
added a round-house to the mill.&nbsp; The round-house is
commonly used as a kind of store-room.</p>
<p>Abel Lake&rsquo;s windmill had no separate
dwelling-house.&nbsp; His grandfather had built the windmill, and
even his father had left it to the son to add a dwelling-house,
when he should perhaps have extended his resources by a bit of
farming or some other business, such as windmillers often add to
their trade proper.&nbsp; But that calamity of the broken sails
had left Abel Lake no power for further outlay for many years,
and he had to be content to live in the mill.</p>
<p>The dwelling-room was the inner part of the basement
floor.&nbsp; Near the door which led from this into the
round-house was the ladder leading to the next story, and close
by that the opening through which the sacks of grain were drawn
up above.&nbsp; The story above the basement held the millstones
and the &ldquo;smutting&rdquo; machine, for cleaning dirty
wheat.&nbsp; The next above that held the dressing machine, in
which the bran was separated from the flour.&nbsp; In the next
above that were the corn-bins.&nbsp; To the next above that the
grain was drawn up from the basement in the first instance.&nbsp;
The top story of all held the machinery connected with the
turning of the sails.&nbsp; Ladders led from story to story, and
each room had two windows on opposite sides of the mill.</p>
<p>Use is second nature, and all the sounds which haunt a
windmill were soon as familiar and as pleasant to the little Jan
as if he had been born a windmiller&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Through
many a windy night he slept as soundly as a sailor in a breeze
which might disturb the nerves of a land-lubber.&nbsp; And when
the north wind blew keen and steadily, and the chains jangled as
the sacks of grist went upwards, and the millstones ground their
monotonous music above his head, these sounds were only as a
lullaby to his slumbers, and disturbed him no more than they
troubled his foster-mother, to whom the revolving stones ground
out a homely and welcome measure: &ldquo;Dai-ly bread, dai-ly
bread, dai-ly bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For another sign of his being a true child of the mill, his
nurse Abel anxiously watched.</p>
<p>Though Abel preferred nursing to pig-minding, he had a higher
ambition yet, which was to begin his career as a
windmiller.&nbsp; It was not likely that he could be of use to
his father for a year or two, and the fact that he was of very
great use to his mother naturally tended to delay his promotion
to the mill.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake was never allowed to say no to her husband, and she
seemed to be unable, and was certainly unwilling, to say it to
her children.&nbsp; Happily, her eldest child was of so sweet and
docile a temper that spoiling did him little harm; but even with
him her inability to say no got the mother into
difficulties.&nbsp; She was obliged to invent excuses to
&ldquo;fub off,&rdquo; when she could neither consent nor
refuse.</p>
<p>So, when Abel used to cling about her, crying, &ldquo;Mother
dear, when&rsquo;ll I be put t&rsquo;help father in the
mill?&nbsp; Do &rsquo;ee ask un to let me come in now!&nbsp; I be
able to sweep &rsquo;s well as Gearge.&nbsp; I sweeps the room
for thee,&rdquo;&mdash;she had not the heart or the courage to
say, &ldquo;I want thee, and thy father doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; but
she would take the boy&rsquo;s hand tenderly in hers, and making
believe to examine his thumbs with a purpose, would reply,
&ldquo;Wait a bit, love.&nbsp; Thee&rsquo;s a sprack boy, and a
good un, but thee&rsquo;s not rightly got the miller&rsquo;s
thumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus it came about that Abel was for ever sifting bits of
flour through his finger and thumb, to obtain the required
flatness and delicacy which marks the latter in a miller born;
and playing lovingly with little Jan on the floor of the
round-house, he would pass some through the baby&rsquo;s fingers
also, crying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sift un, Janny! sift un!&nbsp; Thee&rsquo;s a
miller&rsquo;s lad, and thee must have a miller&rsquo;s
thumb.&rdquo;</p>

27</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">BLACK AS
SLANS.&mdash;VAIR AND VOOLISH.&mdash;THE MILLER AND HIS
MAN.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a great and important time
to Abel when Jan learned to walk; but, as he was neither
precocious nor behindhand in this respect, his biographer may be
pardoned for not dwelling on it at any length.</p>
<p>He had a charming demure little face, chiefly differing from
the faces of the other children of the district by an
overwhelming superiority in the matter of forehead.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake had had great hopes that he would differ in another
respect also.</p>
<p>Most of the children of the neighborhood were fair.&nbsp; Not
fair as so many North-country children are, with locks of
differing, but equally brilliant, shades of gold, auburn, red,
and bronze; but white-headed, and often white-faced, with
white-lashed inexpressive eyes, as if they had been bleaching
through several generations.</p>
<p>Now, when the dark bright eyes of the little Jan first came to
be of tender interest with Mrs. Lake, she fully hoped, and
constantly prophesied, that he would be &ldquo;as black as a
rook;&rdquo; a style of complexion to which she gave a distinct
preference, though the miller was fair by nature as well as white
by trade.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s eyes seemed conclusive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black as slans they be,&rdquo; said his
foster-mother.&nbsp; And slans meant sloe-berries where Mrs. Lake
was born.</p>
<p>An old local saying had something perhaps to do with her
views:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lang and lazy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Black and proud;<br />
Vair and voolish,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Little and loud.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Fair and foolish&rdquo; youngsters certainly abounded
in the neighborhood to an extent which justified a wish for a
change.</p>
<p>As to pride, meek Mrs. Lake was far from regarding it as a
failing in those who had any thing to be proud of, such as black
hair and a possible connection with the gentry.&nbsp; And fate
having denied to her any chance of being proud or aggressive on
her own account, she derived a curious sort of second-hand
satisfaction from seeing these qualities in those who belonged to
her.&nbsp; It did to some extent console her for the
miller&rsquo;s roughness to herself, to hear him rating
George.&nbsp; And she got a sort of reflected dignity out of
being able to say, &ldquo;My maester&rsquo;s a man as will have
his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her hopes were not realized.&nbsp; That yellow into which
the beefsteak stage of Jan&rsquo;s infant complexion had faded
was not destined to deepen into gipsy hues.&nbsp; It gave place
to the tints of the China rose, and all the wind and sunshine on
the downs could not tan, though they sometimes burnt, his
cheeks.&nbsp; The hair on his little head became more abundant,
but it kept its golden hue.&nbsp; His eyes remained dark,&mdash;a
curious mixture; for as to hair and complexion he was
irredeemably fair.</p>
<p>The mill had at least one &ldquo;vair and voolish&rdquo;
inmate, by common account, though by his own (given in confidence
to intimate friends) he was &ldquo;not zuch a vool as he
looked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was George Sannel, the miller&rsquo;s man.</p>
<p>Master Lake had had a second hand in to help on that stormy
night when Jan made his first appearance at the mill; but as a
rule he only kept one man, whom he hired for a year at a time, at
the mop or hiring fair held yearly in the next town.</p>
<p>George, or Gearge as he was commonly called, had been more
than two years in the windmill, and was looked upon in all
respects as &ldquo;one of the family.&rdquo;&nbsp; He slept on a
truckle-bed in the round-house, which, though of average size,
would not permit him to stretch his legs too recklessly without
exposing his feet to the cold.</p>
<p>For &ldquo;Gearge&rdquo; was six feet one and three-quarters
in his stockings.</p>
<p>He had a face in some respects like a big baby&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
He had a turn-up nose, large smooth cheeks, a particularly
innocent expression, a forehead hardly worth naming, small dull
eyes, with a tendency to inflammation of the lids which may
possibly have hindered the lashes from growing, and a mouth which
was generally open, if he were neither eating nor sucking a
&ldquo;bennet.&rdquo;&nbsp; When this countenance was bathed in
flour, it might be an open question whether it were improved or
no.&nbsp; It certainly looked both &ldquo;vairer&rdquo; and more
&ldquo;voolish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is some evidence to show that he was &ldquo;lazy,&rdquo;
as well as &ldquo;lang,&rdquo; and yet he and Master Lake
contrived to pull on together.</p>
<p>Either because his character was as childlike as his face, and
because&mdash;if stupid and slothful by nature&mdash;he was also
of so submissive, susceptible, and willing a temper that he
disarmed the justest wrath; or because he was, as he said, not
such a fool as he looked, and had in his own lubberly way taken
the measure of the masterful windmiller to a nicety,
George&rsquo;s most flagrant acts of neglect had never yet
secured his dismissal.</p>
<p>Indeed, it really is difficult to realize that any one who is
lavish of willingness by word can wilfully and culpably fail in
deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be a uncommon vool, maester, sartinly,&rdquo;
blubbered George on one occasion when the miller was on the point
of turning him off, as a preliminary step on the road to the
&ldquo;gallus,&rdquo; which Master Lake expressed his belief that
he was &ldquo;sartin sure to come to.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as he
spoke, George made dismal daubs on his befloured face with his
sleeve, as he rubbed his eyes with his arm from elbow to
wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sech a governor as you be, too!&rdquo; he
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor mother! she allus said I should come
to no good, such a gawney as I be!&nbsp; No more I
shouldn&rsquo;t but for you, Master Lake, a-keeping of me
on.&nbsp; Give un another chance, sir, do &rsquo;ee!&nbsp; I be
mortal stoopid, sir, but I&rsquo;d work my fingers to the bwoan
for the likes of you, Master Lake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>George stayed on, and though the very next time the windmiller
was absent his &ldquo;voolish&rdquo; assistant did not get so
much as a toll-dish of corn ground to flour, he was so full of
penitence and promises that he weathered that tempest and many a
succeeding one.</p>
<p>On that very eventful night of the storm, and of Jan&rsquo;s
arrival, George&rsquo;s neglect had risked a recurrence of the
sail catastrophe.&nbsp; At least if the second man&rsquo;s report
was to be trusted.</p>
<p>This man had complained to the windmiller that, during his
absence with the strangers, George, instead of doubling his
vigilance now that the men were left short-handed, had taken
himself off under pretext of attending to the direction of the
wind and the position of the sails outside, a most important
matter, to which he had not, after all, paid the slightest heed;
and what he did with himself, whilst leaving the mill to its fate
and the fury of the storm, his indignant fellow-servant professed
himself &ldquo;blessed if he knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But few people are as grateful as they should be when informed
of misconduct in their own servants.&nbsp; It is a reflection on
one&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<p>And unpardonable as George&rsquo;s conduct was, if the tale
were true, the words in which he couched his self-defence were so
much more grateful to the ears of the windmiller than the
somewhat free and independent style in which the other man
expressed his opinion of George&rsquo;s conduct and qualities,
that the master took his servant&rsquo;s part, and snubbed the
informer for his pains.</p>
<p>In justice to George, too, it should be said that he stoutly
and repeatedly denied the whole story, with many oaths and
imprecations of horrible calamities upon himself if he were lying
in the smallest particular.&nbsp; And this with reiteration so
steady, and a countenance so guileless and unmoved, as to
contrast favorably with the face of the other man, whose voice
trembled and whose forehead flushed, either with overwhelming
indignation or with a guilty consciousness that he was bearing
false witness.</p>
<p>Master Lake employed him no more, and George stayed on.</p>
<p>But, for that matter, Master Lake&rsquo;s disposition was not
one which permitted him to profit by the best qualities of those
connected with him.&nbsp; He was a bit of a tyrant, and more than
one man, six times as clever, and ten times as hard-working as
George, had gone when George would have stayed, from crossing
words with the windmiller.&nbsp; The safety of the priceless
sails, if all were true, had been risked by the man he kept, and
secured by the man he sent away, but Master Lake was quite
satisfied with his own decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bean&rsquo;t so fond myself of men as is so mortal
sprack and fussy in a strange place,&rdquo; the miller observed
to Mrs. Lake in reference to this matter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake had picked up several of her husband&rsquo;s bits of
proverbial wisdom, which she often flattered him by retailing to
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too hot to hold, mostly,&rdquo; was her reply, in
knowing tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, missus, so a be,&rdquo; said the
windmiller.&nbsp; And after a while he added, &ldquo;Gearge is
slow, sartinly, mortal slow; but Gearge is sure.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE POCKET-BOOK AND THE
FAMILY BIBLE.&mdash;FIVE POUNDS&rsquo; REWARD.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the strange gentleman who
brought Jan to the windmill, the Lakes heard no more, but the
money was paid regularly through a lawyer in London.</p>
<p>From this lawyer, indeed, Master Lake had heard immediately
after the arrival of his foster-son.</p>
<p>The man of business wrote to say that the gentleman who had
visited the mill on a certain night had, at that date, lost a
pocket-book, which he thought might have been picked up at the
mill.&nbsp; It contained papers only valuable to the owner, and
also a five-pound note, which was liberally offered to the
windmiller if he could find the book, and forward it at once.</p>
<p>Master Lake began to have a kind of reckless, gambling sort of
feeling about luck.&nbsp; Here would be an easily earned five
pounds, if he could but have the luck to find the missing
property!&nbsp; That ten shillings a week had come pretty easily
to him.&nbsp; When all is said, there <i>are</i> people into
whose mouths the larks fall ready cooked!</p>
<p>The windmiller looked inside the mill and outside the mill,
and wandered a long way along the chalky road with his eyes
downwards, but he was no nearer to the five-pound note for his
pains.&nbsp; Then he went to his wife, but she had seen nothing
of the pocket-book; on which her husband somewhat unreasonably
observed that, &ldquo;A might a been zartin <i>thee</i>
couldn&rsquo;t help un!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He next betook himself to George, who was slowly, and it is to
be hoped surely, sweeping out the round-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gearge, my boy,&rdquo; said the windmiller, in not too
anxious tones, &ldquo;have &rsquo;ee seen a pocket-book lying
about anywheres?&rdquo;</p>
<p>George leaned upon his broom with one hand, and with the other
scratched his white head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be a pocket-book, then, Master Lake?&rdquo; said
he, grinning, as if at his own ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s eerd of a pocket-book before now, thee
vool, sure-ly!&rdquo; said the impatient windmiller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;se eerd of a pocket of hops, Master
Lake,&rdquo; said George, after an irritating pause, during which
he still smiled, and scratched his poll as if to stimulate
recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Book&mdash;book&mdash;book! pocket-<i>book</i>!&rdquo;
shouted the miller.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thee can&rsquo;t read, thee
knows what a book is, thee gawney!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a vool I be, to be sure!&rdquo; said George, his
simple countenance lighted up with a broader smile than
before.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knows a book, sartinly, Master Lake, I
knows a book.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s one,&rdquo; George continued,
speaking even slower than before,&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s one
inzide, sir,&mdash;a big un.&nbsp; On the shelf it be.&nbsp; A
Vamly Bible they calls un.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m sartin sure it be
there,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;for a hasn&rsquo;t been moved
since the last time you christened, Master Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miller turned away, biting his lip hard, to repress a
useless outburst of rage, and George, still smiling sweetly, spun
the broom dexterously between his hands, as a man spins the water
out of a stable mop.&nbsp; Just before Master Lake had got beyond
earshot, George lowered the broom, and began to scratch his head
once more.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be a proper vool, sartinly,&rdquo; said
he; and when the miller heard this, he turned back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mother allus said I&rsquo;d no more sense in my yead than
a dumbledore,&rdquo; George candidly confessed.&nbsp; And by a
dumbledore he meant a humble-bee.&nbsp; &ldquo;It do take me such
a time to mind any thing, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind, Gearge,&rdquo; said the miller;
&ldquo;if thee&rsquo;s slow, thee&rsquo;s sure.&nbsp; What do
&rsquo;ee remember about the book, now, Gearge?&nbsp; A
don&rsquo;t mind giving thee five shilling, if thee finds un,
Gearge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A had un down at the burying, I &rsquo;member quite
well now, sir.&nbsp; To put the little un&rsquo;s name in
&rsquo;twas.&nbsp; I thowt a hadn&rsquo;t been down zince
christening, I be so stoopid sartinly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, ye vool?&rdquo; roared the
miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book, sir, sartinly,&rdquo; said George, his honest
face beaming with good-humor.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Vamly Bible,
Master Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the windmiller went off muttering something which the
Family Bible would by no means have sanctioned, George returned
chuckling to a leisurely use of his broom on the round-house
floor.</p>
<p>Master Lake did not find the pocket-book, and after a day or
two it was advertised in a local paper, and a reward of five
pounds offered for it.</p>
<p>George Sannel was seated one evening in the &ldquo;Heart of
Oak&rdquo; inn, sipping some excellent home-brewed ale, which had
been warmed up for his consumption in a curious funnel-shaped
pipkin, when his long lop-ears caught a remark made by the
inn-keeper, who was reading out bits from the local paper to a
small audience, unable to read it for themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five pound reward!&rdquo; he read.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lor
massy!&nbsp; There be a sum to be easily earned by a sharp-eyed
chap with good luck on &rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how then, Master Chuter?&rdquo; said George,
pausing, with the steaming mug half-way to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw, haw!&rdquo; roared the inn-keeper: &ldquo;you be a
sharp-eyed chap, too!&nbsp; Do &rsquo;ee think &rsquo;twould suit
thee, Gearge?&nbsp; Thee&rsquo;s a sprack chap, sartinly,
Gearge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw, haw, haw!&rdquo; roared the other members of the
company, as they slowly realized Master Chuter&rsquo;s irony at
the expense of the &ldquo;voolish&rdquo; Gearge.</p>
<p>George took their rough banter in excellent part.&nbsp; He
sipped his beer, and grinned like a cat at his own expense.&nbsp;
But after the guffaws had subsided, he said, &ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s
not told un about that five pound yet, Master Chuter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curiosity of the company was by this time aroused, and
Master Chuter explained: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a gentleman by the
name of Ford as is advertising for a pocket-book, a seems to have
lost on the downs, near to Master Lake&rsquo;s windmill.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis thy way, too, Gearge, after all.&nbsp; Thee must get
up yarly, Gearge.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the yarly bird catches the
worm.&nbsp; And tell Master Lake from me, &rsquo;ll have all the
young varments in the place a driving their pigs up to his mill,
to look for the pocket-book, while they makes believe to be
minding their pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis likely, too,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; And
the two or three very aged laborers in smocks, and one other
lubberly boy, who composed the rest of the circle, added,
severally and collectively, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis likely,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, as George beat his way home over the downs in the dusk,
he said aloud, under cover of the roaring wind, and in all the
security of the open country,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vive pound! vive pound!&nbsp; And a offered me vive
shilling for un.&nbsp; Master Lake, you be dog-ged cute; but
Gearge bean&rsquo;t quite such a vool as a looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a short time the advertisement was withdrawn.</p>

COURTING.&mdash;GEORGE AS AN ENEMY.&mdash;GEORGE AS A
FRIEND.&mdash;ABEL PLAYS SCHOOL-MASTER.&mdash;THE
LOVE-LETTER.&mdash;MOERDYK.&mdash;THE MILLER-MOTH.&mdash;AN
ANCIENT DITTY.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day George Sannel asked and
obtained leave for a holiday.</p>
<p>On the morning in question, he dressed himself in the cleanest
of smocks, greased his boots, stuck a bloody warrior, or
dark-colored wallflower, in his bosom, put a neatly folded, clean
cotton handkerchief into his pocket,&mdash;which, even if he did
not use it, was a piece of striking dandyism,&mdash;and scrubbed
his honest face to such a point of cleanliness that Mrs. Lake was
almost constrained to remark that she thought he must be going
courting.</p>
<p>George did not blush,&mdash;he never blushed,&mdash;but he
looked &ldquo;voolish&rdquo; enough to warrant the suspicion that
his errand was a tender one, and he had no other reason to give
for his spruce appearance.</p>
<p>It was, perhaps, in his confusion that he managed to convey a
mistaken notion of the place to which he was going to Mrs.
Lake.&nbsp; She was under the impression that he went to the
neighboring town, whereas he went to one in an exactly opposite
direction, and some miles farther away.</p>
<p>He went to the bank, too, which seems an unlikely place for
tender tryst; but George&rsquo;s proceedings were apt to be less
direct than the simplicity of his looks and speech would have led
a stranger to suppose.&nbsp; When he reached home, the windmiller
and his family were going to bed, for the night was still, and
the mill idle.&nbsp; George betook himself at once to where his
truckle-bed stood in the round-house, and proceeded to light his
mill-candlestick, which was stuck into the wall.</p>
<p>From the chink into which it was stuck he then counted seven
bricks downwards, and the seventh yielded to a slight effort and
came out.&nbsp; It was the door, so to speak, of a hole in the
wall of the mill, from which he drew a morocco-bound
pocket-book.&nbsp; After an uneasy glance over his shoulder, to
make sure that the long dark shadow which stretched from his own
heels, and shifted with the draught in which the candle flared,
was not the windmiller creeping up behind him, he took a letter
out of the book and held it to the light as if to read it.&nbsp;
But he never turned the page, and at last replaced it with a
sigh.&nbsp; Then he put the pocket-book back into the hole, and
pushed in after it his handkerchief, which was tied round
something which chinked as he pressed it in.&nbsp; Then he
replaced the brick, and went to bed.&nbsp; He said nothing about
the bank in the morning nor about the hole in the mill-wall; and
he parried Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s questions with gawky grins and
well-assumed bashfulness.</p>
<p>Abel overheard his mother&rsquo;s jokes on the subject of
&ldquo;Gearge&rsquo;s young &rsquo;ooman,&rdquo; and they
recurred to him when he and George formed a curious alliance,
which demands explanation.</p>
<p>It was not solely because the windmiller looked favorably upon
the little Jan that he and Abel were now allowed to wander in the
business parts of the windmill, when they could not be out of
doors, to an extent never before permitted to the children.&nbsp;
Part of the change was due to a change in the miller&rsquo;s
man.</p>
<p>However childlike in some respects himself, George was not
fond of children, and he had hitherto seemed to have a particular
spite against Abel.&nbsp; He, quite as often as the miller, would
drive the boy from the round-house, and thwart his fancy for
climbing the ladders to see the processes of the different
floors.</p>
<p>Abel would have been happy for hours together watching the
great stones grind, or the corn poured by golden showers into the
hopper on its way to the stones below.&nbsp; Many a time had he
crept up and hidden himself behind a sack; but George seemed to
have an impish ingenuity in discovering his hiding-places, and
would drive him out as a dog worries a cat, crying, &ldquo;Come
out, thee little varment!&nbsp; Master Lake he don&rsquo;t allow
thee hereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cleverness of the miller&rsquo;s man in discovering poor
Abel&rsquo;s retreats probably arose from the fact that he had so
rooted a dislike for the routine work of his daily duties that he
would rather employ himself about the mill in any way than by
attending to the mill-business, and that his idleness and
stupidity over work were only equalled by his industry and
shrewdness in mischief.</p>
<p>Poor Abel had a dread of the great, gawky, mischievous-looking
man, which probably prevented his complaining to his mother of
many a sly pinch and buffet which he endured from him.&nbsp; And
George took some pains to keep up this wholesome awe of himself,
by vague and terrifying speeches, and by a trick of what he
called &ldquo;dropping on&rdquo; poor Abel in the dusk, with
hideous grimaces and uncouth sounds.</p>
<p>He once came thus upon Abel in an upper floor, and the boy
fled from him so hastily that he caught his foot in the ladder
and fell headlong.&nbsp; Though it must have been quite uncertain
for some moments whether Abel had not broken his neck, the
miller&rsquo;s man displayed no anxiety.&nbsp; He only clapped
his hands upon his knees, in a sort of uncouth ecstasy of spite,
saying, &ldquo;Down a comes vlump, like a twoad from roost.&nbsp;
Haw, haw, haw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happily, Abel fell with little more damage to himself than the
mill-cats experienced in many such a tumble, as they fled before
the tormenting George.</p>
<p>But, after all this, it was with no small surprise that Abel
found himself the object of attentions from the miller&rsquo;s
man, which bore the look of friendliness.</p>
<p>At first, when George made civil speeches, and invited Abel to
&ldquo;see the stwones a-grinding,&rdquo; he only felt an
additional terror, being convinced that mischief was meant in
reality.&nbsp; But, when days and weeks went by, and he wandered
unmolested from floor to floor, with many a kindly word from
George, and not a single cuff or nip, the sweet-tempered Abel
began to feel gratitude, and almost an affection, for his quondam
tormentor.</p>
<p>George, for his part, had hitherto done some violence to his
own feelings by his constant refusal to allow Abel to help him to
sweep the mill or couple the sacks for lifting.&nbsp; He would
have been only too glad to put some of his own work on the
shoulders of another, had it not been for the vexatious thought
that he would be giving pleasure by so doing where he only wanted
to annoy.&nbsp; And in his very unamiable disposition malice was
a stronger quality even than idleness.</p>
<p>But now, when for some reason best known to himself, he wished
to win Abel&rsquo;s regard, it was a slight recompense to him for
restraining his love of tormenting that he got a good deal of
work out of Abel at odd moments when the miller was away.&nbsp;
So well did he manage this, that a marked improvement in the
tidiness of the round-house drew some praise from his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;ll be a sprack man yet, Gearge,&rdquo; said
the windmiller, encouragingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thee takes the broom
into the corners now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I do,&rdquo; said George, unblushingly, &ldquo;so I
do.&nbsp; But lor, Master Lake, what a man you be to notice
un!&rdquo;&nbsp; George&rsquo;s kinder demeanor towards Abel
began shortly after the coming of the little Jan, and George
himself accounted for it in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do be kind to me now, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel,
gratefully, as he stood one day, with the baby in his arms,
watching the miller&rsquo;s man emptying a sack of grain into the
hopper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I likes to see thee with that babby, Abel,&rdquo; said
George, pausing in his work.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s a good
boy, Abel, and careful.&nbsp; I likes to do any thing for thee,
Abel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could do any thing for thee, Gearge,&rdquo;
said Abel; &ldquo;but I be too small to help the likes of you,
Gearge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re small, you&rsquo;re sprack,&rdquo; said
the miller&rsquo;s man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s a good scholar,
too, Abel.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be bound thee can read, now?&nbsp;
And a poor gawney like I doesn&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s
letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can read a bit, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel, with pride;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been at home a goodish while; but mother
says she&rsquo;ll send I to school again in spring, if the little
un gets on well and walks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could read,&rdquo; said George, mournfully;
&ldquo;but time&rsquo;s past for me to go to school, Abel; and
who&rsquo;d teach a great lummakin vool like I his
letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would, Gearge, I would!&rdquo; cried Abel, his eyes
sparkling with earnestness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can teach thee thy
letters, and by the time thee&rsquo;s learned all I know, maybe
I&rsquo;ll have been to school again, and learned some
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the foundation of a curious kind of friendship
between Abel and the miller&rsquo;s man.</p>
<p>On the same shelf with the &ldquo;Vamly Bible,&rdquo; before
alluded to, was a real old horn-book, which had belonged to the
windmiller&rsquo;s grandmother.&nbsp; It was simply a sheet on
which the letters of the alphabet, and some few words of one
syllable, were printed, and it was protected in its frame by a
transparent front of thin horn, through which the letters could
be read, just as one sees the prints through the ground-glass of
&ldquo;drawing slates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this horn-book Abel labored patiently in teaching George
his letters.&nbsp; It was no light task.&nbsp; George had all the
cunning and shrewdness with which he credited himself; but a
denser head for any intellectual effort could hardly have been
found for the seeking.&nbsp; Still they struggled on, and as
George went about the mill he might have been heard
muttering,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A B C G.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Cuss me for a vool!&nbsp; A B
C <i>D</i>.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t they whop my letters into I
when a was a boy?&nbsp; A B C&rdquo;&mdash;and so persevering
with an industry which he commonly kept for works of
mischief.</p>
<p>One evening he brought home a newspaper from the Heart of Oak,
and when Mrs. Lake had taken the baby, he persuaded Abel to come
into the round-house and give him a lesson.&nbsp; Abel could read
so much of it that George was quite overwhelmed by his
learning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee be&rsquo;s mortal larned, Abel, sartinly.&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;ll never read like thee,&rdquo; he added,
despairingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drattle th&rsquo; old witch; why
didn&rsquo;t she give I some schooling?&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke
with spiteful emphasis, and Abel, too well used to his rough
language to notice the uncivil reference to his mother, said with
some compassion,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you never sent to school then, Gearge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should ha&rsquo; kept me there,&rdquo; said
George, self-defensively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I played moocher,&rdquo;
he continued,&mdash;by which he meant truant,&mdash;&ldquo;and
then they whopped I, and a went home to mother, and she kept un
at home, the old vool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Gearge, thee must work hard, and I&rsquo;ll teach
thee, Gearge, I&rsquo;ll teach thee!&rdquo; said little Abel,
proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And by-and-by, Gearge, we&rsquo;ll get a
slate, and I&rsquo;ll teach thee to write too, Gearge, that I
will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>George&rsquo;s small eyes gave a slight squint, as they were
apt to do when he was thinking profoundly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can thee read writing, my
boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel, &ldquo;if
&rsquo;twas pretty plain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abel, my boy,&rdquo; said George, after a pause, with a
broad sweet smile upon his &ldquo;voolish&rdquo; face, &ldquo;go
to the door and see if the wind be rising at all; us
mustn&rsquo;t forget th&rsquo; old mill, Abel, with us
larning.&nbsp; Sartinly not, Abel, mun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proud of the implied partnership in the care of the mill, Abel
hastened to the outer door.&nbsp; As he passed the inner one,
leading into the dwelling-room, he could hear his mother crooning
a strange, drony, old local ditty, as she put the little Jan to
sleep.&nbsp; As Abel went out, she was singing the first
verse:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The swallow twitters on the barn,<br />
The rook is cawing on the tree,<br />
And in the wood the ringdove coos,<br />
But my false love hath fled from me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abel opened the door, and looked out.&nbsp; One of those small
white moths known as &ldquo;millers&rdquo; went past him.&nbsp;
The night was still,&mdash;so utterly still that no sound of any
sort whatever broke upon the ear.&nbsp; In dead silence and
loneliness stood the mill.&nbsp; Even the miller-moth had gone;
and a cat ran in by Abel&rsquo;s legs, as if the loneliness
without were too much for her.&nbsp; The sky was gray.</p>
<p>Abel went back to the round-house, where George was struggling
to fix the candlestick securely in the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cuss the thing!&rdquo; he exclaimed, whilst the skin of
his face took a mottled hue that was the nearest approach he ever
made to a blush.&nbsp; &ldquo;The tallow&rsquo;ve been a
dropping, Abel, my boy.&nbsp; I think &rsquo;twas the wind when
you opened the door, maybe.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve been a trying to
fix un more firmly.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all, Abel; that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no signs of wind,&rdquo; said
Abel.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s main quiet and unked too outside,
Gearge.&nbsp; And I do think it be like rain.&nbsp; There was a
miller-moth, Gearge; do that mean any thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
bean&rsquo;t weatherwise myself, Abel.&nbsp; But if there be no
wind, there be no work, Abel; so us may go back to our
larning.&nbsp; Look here, my boy,&rdquo; he added, as Abel
reseated himself on the grain-sack which did duty as chair of
instruction, and drawing, as he spoke, a letter forth to the
light; &ldquo;come to the candle, Abel, and see if so be thee can
read this, but don&rsquo;t tell any one I showed it thee,
Abel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel, warmly; and he
added,&mdash;&ldquo;Be it from thy young &rsquo;ooman,
Gearge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No rustic swain ever simpered more consciously or looked more
foolish than George under this accusation, as he said, &ldquo;Be
quiet, Abel, do &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She be a good scholar, too!&rdquo; said Abel, looking
admiringly at the closely written sheet.</p>
<p>George could hardly disguise the sudden look of fury in his
face, but he hastily covered up the letter with his hands in such
a manner as only to leave the first word on the page
visible.&nbsp; There was a deeply cunning reason for this clever
man&oelig;uvre.&nbsp; George held himself to be pretty
&ldquo;cute,&rdquo; and he reckoned that, by only showing one
word at a time, he could effectually prevent any attempt on
Abel&rsquo;s part to read the letter himself without giving its
contents to George.&nbsp; Like many other cunning people, George
overreached himself.&nbsp; The first word was beyond Abel&rsquo;s
powers, though he might possibly have satisfied George&rsquo;s
curiosity on one essential point, by deciphering a name or two
farther on.&nbsp; But the clever George concluded that he had
boasted beyond his ability, so he put the letter away.&nbsp; Abel
tried hard at the one word which George exhibited, and gazed
silently at it for some time with a puzzled face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Spell it, mun, spell it!&rdquo; cried the miller&rsquo;s
man, impatiently.&nbsp; It was a process which he had seen to
succeed, when a long word had puzzled his teacher in the
newspaper, before now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M O E R, mower; D Y K, dik,&rdquo; said Abel.&nbsp; But
he looked none the wiser for the effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mower dik!&nbsp; What be that?&rdquo; said George,
peering at the word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do&rsquo;ee think it be Mower
dik, Abel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be sure,&rdquo; said Abel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or do &rsquo;ee think &rsquo;tis &lsquo;<i>My dear
Dick</i>&rsquo;?&rdquo; suggested George, anxiously, and with a
sort of triumph in his tone, as if that were quite what he
expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an O, Gearge, that second
letter.&nbsp; Besides, twould be <i>My dear Gearge</i> to thee,
thou knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the look with which the miller&rsquo;s man favored Abel
was far from pleasant.&nbsp; But he controlled his voice to its
ordinary drawl (always a little slower and more simple sounding,
when he specially meant mischief).</p>
<p>&ldquo;So &rsquo;twould, Abel.&nbsp; So &rsquo;twould.&nbsp;
What a vool I be, to be sure!&nbsp; But give it to I now.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll look at it another time, Abel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be very sorry, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel, who had a
consciousness that the miller&rsquo;s man was ill-pleased in
spite of his civility.&nbsp; &ldquo;It be so long since I was at
school, and it be such a queer word.&nbsp; Do &rsquo;ee think she
can have spelt un wrong, Gearge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis likely she have,&rdquo; said George,
regaining his composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abel!&nbsp; Abel!&nbsp; Abel!&rdquo; cried the mother
from the dwelling-room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come to bed,
child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Gearge.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m main sorry to be so
stupid, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel, and off he ran.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake was walking up and down, rocking the little Jan in
her arms, who was wailing fretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be puzzled to know what ails un,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Lake, in answer to Abel&rsquo;s questions.&nbsp; &ldquo;He be
quite in a way to-night.&nbsp; But get thee to bed,
Abel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And though Abel begged hard to be allowed to try his powers of
soothing with the little Jan, Mrs. Lake insisted upon keeping the
baby herself; and Abel undressed, and crept into the
press-bed.&nbsp; He fell asleep in spite of a somewhat disturbed
mind.&nbsp; That mysterious word and George&rsquo;s evident
displeasure worried him, and he was troubled also by the unusual
fretfulness of the little Jan, and the sound of sorrow in his
baby wail.&nbsp; His last waking thoughts were a strange mixture,
passing into stranger dreams.</p>
<p>The word Moerdyk danced before his eyes, but brought no
meaning with it.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s cries troubled him, and with
both there blended the droning of the ancient plaintive ditty,
which the foster-mother sang over and over again as she rocked
the child in her arms.&nbsp; That wail of the baby&rsquo;s must
have in some strange manner recalled the first night of his
arrival, when Abel found him wailing on the bed.&nbsp; For the
fierce eyes of the strange gentleman haunted Abel&rsquo;s dreams,
but in the face of the miller&rsquo;s man.</p>
<p>The poor boy dreamed horribly of being &ldquo;dropped
on&rdquo; by George, with fierce black eyes added to the terrors
of his uncouth grimaces.&nbsp; He seemed to himself to fly
blindly and vainly through the mill from his tormentor, till
George was driven from his thoughts by his coming suddenly upon
the little Jan, wailing as he really did wail, round whose head a
miller-moth was sailing slowly, and singing in a human
voice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The swallow twitters on the barn,<br />
The rook is cawing on the tree,<br />
And in the wood the ringdove coos,<br />
But my false love hath fled from me.</p>
<p>Like tiny pipe of wheaten straw,<br />
The wren his little note doth swell,<br />
And every living thing that flies,<br />
Of his true love doth fondly tell.</p>
<p>But I alone am left to pine,<br />
And sit beneath the withy tree;<br />
For truth and honesty be gone,<br />
And my false love hath fled from me.&rdquo;</p>

AGAIN.&mdash;DAME DATCHETT.&mdash;A COLUMN OF
SPELLING.&mdash;ABEL PLAYS MOOCHER.&mdash;THE MILLER&rsquo;S MAN
CANNOT MAKE UP HIS MIND.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Abel</span> went to school again in the
spring, and, though George would have been better pleased had he
forgotten the whole affair, he remembered the word in
George&rsquo;s young woman&rsquo;s love-letter which had puzzled
him; and never was a spelling-lesson set him among the M&rsquo;s
that he did not hope to come across it and to be able to demand
the meaning of Moerdyk from his Dame.</p>
<p>Without the excuse of its coming in the column of spelling set
by herself, Abel dared not ask her to solve his puzzle; for never
did teacher more warmly resent questions which she was unable to
answer than Dame Datchett.</p>
<p>Abel could not fully make up his mind whether it should be
looked up among two-syllabled or three-syllabled words.&nbsp; He
decided for the former, and one day brought his spelling-book to
George in the round-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a looking for that yere word,
Gearge,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of
Mo&rsquo;s, but it bean&rsquo;t among &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Here they
be.&nbsp; Words of two syllables; M, Ma, Me, Mi; here they be,
Mo.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Abel began to rattle off the familiar column
at a good rate, George looking earnestly over his shoulder, and
following the boy&rsquo;s finger as it moved rapidly down the
page.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mocking, Modern, Mohawk, Molar, Molly, Moment,
Money, Moping, Moral, Mortal, Moses, Motive, Movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a bit, mun,&rdquo; cried George; &ldquo;what do
all they words mean?&nbsp; They bothers me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knows some of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Abel, &ldquo;and
I asked Dame Datchett about the others, but she do be so cross;
and I thinks some of &rsquo;em bothered she too.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s mocking.&nbsp; I knows that.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s a modern, Dame?&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
muddle-headed fellow the likes of you,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s a mohawk, Dame?&rsquo; says I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll come to before long, ye young
hang-gallus,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp; I was feared on her, Gearge,
I can tell &rsquo;ee; but I tried my luck again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s a molar, Dame?&rsquo; says I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a wus word than t&rsquo;other,&rsquo; says she;
&lsquo;and, if &rsquo;ee axes me any more voolish questions,
I&rsquo;ll break thee yead for &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;&nbsp; Do
&rsquo;ee think &rsquo;tis a very bad word, Gearge?&rdquo; added
Abel, with a rather indefensible curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard un,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; And this
was perhaps decisive against the Dame&rsquo;s statement.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t believe un neither.&nbsp; I think it
bothered she.&nbsp; I believe &rsquo;tis a genteel word for a man
as catches oonts.&nbsp; They call oonts <i>moles</i> in some
parts, so p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps they calls a man as catches moles a
molar, as they calls a man as drives a mill a miller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis likely too, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; Molly we knows.&nbsp; And moment, and moping,
and moral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s moral?&rdquo; inquired George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis what they put at the end of Vables,
Gearge.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Vables at the end of the
spelling-book, and I&rsquo;ve read un all.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
the Wolf and the Lamb, and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knows now,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis like the last verse of that song about the
Harnet and the Bittle.&nbsp; Go on, Abel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mortal.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s swearing.&nbsp; Moses.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s in the Bible, Gearge.&nbsp; Motive.&nbsp; I thought
I&rsquo;d try un just once more.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s a
motive, Dame?&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got un
here,&rsquo; says she, quite quiet-like.&nbsp; But I seed her
feeling under &rsquo;s chair, and I know&rsquo;d &rsquo;twas for
the strap, and I ran straight off, spelling-book and all,
Gearge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So thee&rsquo;ve been playing moocher, eh?&rdquo; said
George, with an unpleasant twinkle in his eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll Master Lake say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee tell un, Gearge!&rdquo; Abel
implored; &ldquo;and, O Gearge! let I tell mother about the
word.&nbsp; Maybe she&rsquo;ve heard tell of it.&nbsp; Let I show
her the letter, Gearge.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll read it for
&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a scholard, is mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no mistaking now the wrath in George&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; The fury that is fed by fear blazes pretty strongly
at all times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee, Abel, my boy,&rdquo; said he, pinching
Abel&rsquo;s shoulder till he turned red and white with
pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thee ever speaks of that letter and that
word to any mortal soul, I&rsquo;ll tell Master Lake thee plays
moocher, and I&rsquo;ll half kill thee myself.&nbsp; Thee shall
rue the day ever thee was born!&rdquo; he added, almost beside
himself with rage and terror.&nbsp; And as, after a few
propitiating words, Abel fled from the mill, George ground his
hands together and muttered, &ldquo;Motive!&nbsp; I wish the old
witch had motived every bone in thee body, or let me do
&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master George Sannel was indeed a little irritable at this
stage of his career.&nbsp; Like the miller, he had had one stroke
of good luck, but capricious fortune would not follow up the
blow.</p>
<p>He had made five pounds pretty easily.&nbsp; But how to turn
some other property of which he had become possessed to profit
for himself was, after months of waiting, a puzzle still.</p>
<p>He was well aware that his own want of education was the great
hindrance to his discovering for himself the exact worth of what
he had got.&nbsp; And to his suspicious nature the idea of
letting any one else into his secret, even to gain help, was
quite intolerable.</p>
<p>Abel seemed to be no nearer even to the one word that George
had showed him, after weeks of &ldquo;schooling,&rdquo; and
George himself progressed so slowly in learning to read that he
was at times tempted to give up the effort in despair.</p>
<p>Of his late outburst against Abel he afterwards repented, as
impolitic, and was soon good friends again with his very placable
teacher.</p>
<p>Much of the time when he should have been at work did George
spend in &ldquo;puzzling&rdquo; over his position.&nbsp;
Sometimes, as from an upper window of the mill he saw the little
Jan in Abel&rsquo;s arms, he would mutter,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a body were to kidnap un, would they advertise he, I
wonders?&rdquo; and after some consideration would shake his
white head doubtfully, saying, &ldquo;No, they wants to get rid
of un, or they wouldn&rsquo;t have brought un here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happily for poor little Jan, the unscrupulous rustic rejected
the next idea which came to him as too doubtful of success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they&rsquo;d come down something handsome
to them as could tell &rsquo;em the young varmint was off their
hands for good and all.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould save un ten shilling
a week.&nbsp; Ten shilling a week!&nbsp; I heard un with my own
ears.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d a kep&rsquo; un for five, if they&rsquo;d
asked me.&nbsp; I wonders now.&nbsp; Little uns like that does
get stole by gipsies sometimes.&nbsp; Varmer Smith&rsquo;s son
were, and never heard on again.&nbsp; They falls into a mill-race
too sometimes.&nbsp; They be so venturesome.&nbsp; But I doubt
&rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; Them as it belongs to might be
glad enough to get rid of un, and save their credit and their
money too by turning upon I after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miller&rsquo;s man puzzled himself in vain.&nbsp; He could
think of no mode of action at once safe and certain of
success.&nbsp; He did not even know whether what he possessed had
any value, or how or where to make use of it.&nbsp; But a sort of
dim hope of seeing his way yet kept him about the mill, and he
persevered in the effort to learn to read, and kept his big ears
open for any thing that might drop from the miller or his wife to
throw light on the history of Jan, with whom his hopes were bound
up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with a dogged patience, he bided his time.</p>

54</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">VISITORS AT THE
MILL.&mdash;A WINDMILLER OF THE THIRD GENERATION.&mdash;CURE FOR
WHOOPING-COUGH.&mdash;MISS AMABEL ADELINE AMMABY.&mdash;DOCTORS
DISAGREE.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the earliest of Jan&rsquo;s
remembrances&mdash;of those remembrances, I mean, which remained
with him when childhood was past&mdash;was of little Miss Amabel,
from the Grange, being held in the hopper of the windmill for
whooping cough.</p>
<p>Jan was between three and four years old at this time, the
idol of his foster-mother, and a great favorite with his adopted
brothers and sisters.&nbsp; A quaint little fellow he was, with a
broad, intellectual-looking face, serious to old-fashionedness,
very fair, and with eyes &ldquo;like slans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was standing one morning at Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s apron-string,
his arms clasped lovingly, but somewhat too tightly, round the
waist of a sandy kitten, who submitted with wonderful good-humor
to the well-meant strangulation, his black eyes intently fixed
upon the dumplings which his foster-mother was dexterously
rolling together, when a strange footstep was heard shuffling
uncertainly about on the floor of the round-house just outside
the dwelling-room door.&nbsp; Mrs. Lake did not disturb
herself.&nbsp; Country folk were constantly coming with their
bags of grist, and both George and the miller were at hand, for a
nice breeze was blowing, and the mill ground merrily.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, however, came a modest knock on the
room-door, and Mrs. Lake, wiping her hands, proceeded to admit
the knocker.&nbsp; She was a smartly dressed woman, who bore such
a mass of laces and finery, with a white woollen shawl spread
over it, apparently with the purpose of smothering any living
thing there might chance to be beneath, as, in Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s
experienced eyes, could be nothing less than a baby of the most
genteel order.</p>
<p>The manners of the nurse were most genteel also, and might
have quite overpowered Mrs. Lake, but that the windmiller&rsquo;s
wife had in her youth been in good service herself, and, though
an early marriage had prevented her from rising beyond the post
of nursemaid, she was fairly familiar with the etiquette of the
nursery and of the servants&rsquo; hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the nurse, who
no sooner ceased to walk than she began a kind of diagonal
movement without progression, in which one heel clacked, and all
her petticoats swung, and the baby who, head downwards, was
snorting with gaping mouth under the woollen coverlet, was
supposed to be soothed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good morning,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll excuse my
intruding&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, mum,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake.&nbsp; By which
she did not mean to reject the excuse, but to disclaim the
intrusion.</p>
<p>When the nurse was not speaking, she kept time to her own
rocking by a peculiar click of her tongue against the roof of her
mouth; and indeed it sometimes mingled, almost confusingly, with
her conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very obliging,
ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said she, and, persuaded by
Mrs. Lake, she took a seat.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me
for asking a singular question, ma&rsquo;am, but <i>was your
husband&rsquo;s father and grandfather both
millers</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They was, mum,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
husband&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s father built this mill where we
now stands.&nbsp; It cost him a deal of money, and he died with a
debt upon it.&nbsp; My husband&rsquo;s father paid un off; and he
meant to have built a house, mum, but he never did, worse luck
for us.&nbsp; He allus says, says he,&mdash;that&rsquo;s my
husband&rsquo;s father, mum,&mdash;&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll leave that
to Abel,&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s my maester, mum.&nbsp; But
nine year ago come Michaelmas&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s story was here interrupted by a frightful
outburst of coughing from the unfortunate baby, who on the
removal of the woollen shawl presented an appearance which would
have been comical but for the sympathy its condition
demanded.</p>
<p>A very red and utterly shapeless little face lay, like a
crushed beet-root, in a mass of dainty laces almost voluminous
enough to have dressed out a bride.&nbsp; As a sort of crowning
satire, the face in particular was surrounded by a broad frill,
spotted with bunches of pink satin ribbon, and farther encased in
a white satin hood of elaborate workmanship and fringes.</p>

 src="images/p56s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The contrast between the natural red of the baby&rsquo;s
complexion and its snowy finery was ludicrously suggestive of an
over-dressed nigger, to begin with; but when, in the paroxysms of
its cough, the tiny creature&rsquo;s face passed by shades of
plum-color to a bluish black, the result was appalling to
behold.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s experienced ears were not slow to discover
that the child had got whooping-cough, which the nurse confessed
was the case.&nbsp; She also apologized for bringing in the baby
among Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s children, saying that she had
&ldquo;thought of nothing but the poor little chirrub
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t name it, mum,&rdquo; replied the
windmiller&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always say if children be
to have things, they&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em; and if not, why
they won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; A theory which seems to sum up the
views of the majority of people in Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s class of
life upon the spread of disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s coming
to my poor head,&rdquo; the nurse continued: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
not so much as told you who I am, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
nurse at the Grange, ma&rsquo;am, with Mr. Ammaby and Lady
Louisa.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve been in town, and her
ladyship&rsquo;s had the very best advice, and now we&rsquo;ve
come to the country for three months, but the dear child
don&rsquo;t seem a bit the better.&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ve been
trying every thing, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; For any thing I heard
of I&rsquo;ve tried, as well as what the doctor ordered, and
rubbing it with some stuff Lady Louisa&rsquo;s mamma insisted
upon, too,&mdash;even to a frog put into the dear child&rsquo;s
mouth, and drawed back by its legs, that&rsquo;s supposed to be a
certain cure, but only frightened it into a fit I thought it
never would have come out of, as well as fetching her ladyship
all the way from her boudoir to know what was the
matter&mdash;which I no more dared tell her than fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; said the miller&rsquo;s wife;
&ldquo;have you tried goose-grease, mum?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an
excellent thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goose-grease, ma&rsquo;am, and an excellent ointment
from the bone-setter&rsquo;s at the toll-bar, which the butler
paid for out of his own pocket, knowing it to have done a world
of good to his sister that had a bad leg, besides being a certain
cure for coughs, and cancer, and consumption as well.&nbsp; And
then the doctor&rsquo;s <i>imprecation</i> on its little chest,
night and morning, besides; but nothing don&rsquo;t seem to do no
good,&rdquo; said the poor nurse.&nbsp; &ldquo;And so,
ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;her ladyship being gone to the
town,&mdash;thinks I, I&rsquo;ll take the dear child to the
windmill.&nbsp; For they do say,&mdash;where I came from,
ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;that if a miller, that&rsquo;s the son of a
miller, and the grandson of a miller, holds a child that&rsquo;s
got the whooping-cough in the hopper of the mill whilst the
mill&rsquo;s going, it cures them, however bad they
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reason of the nurse&rsquo;s visit being now made known,
Mrs. Lake called her husband, and explained to him what he was
asked to do for &ldquo;her ladyship&rsquo;s baby.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The miller scratched his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard my father say that his brother that
drove a mill in Cheshire had had it to do,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but I never did it myself, ma&rsquo;am, nor ever see un
done.&nbsp; And a hopper be an ackerd place, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve ground many a cat in this mill, from getting in the
hopper at nights for warmth.&nbsp; However,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;I suppose I can hold the little lady pretty
tight.&rdquo;&nbsp; And finally, though with some unwillingness,
the miller consented to try the charm; being chiefly influenced
by the wish not to disoblige the gentlefolk at the Grange.</p>
<p>The little Jan had watched the proceedings of the visitors
with great attention.&nbsp; During the poor baby&rsquo;s fit of
coughing, he was so absorbed that the sandy kitten slipped
through his arms and made off, with her tail as stiff as a
sentry&rsquo;s musket; and now that the miller took the baby into
his arms, Jan became excited, and asked, &ldquo;What daddy do
with un?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old-fashioned little piece!&rdquo; exclaimed the
nurse, admiringly.&nbsp; And Mrs. Lake added, &ldquo;Let un see
the little lady, maester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miller held out the baby, and the nurse, removing a dainty
handkerchief edged with Valenciennes lace from its face,
introduced it as &ldquo;Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby;&rdquo; and
Mrs. Lake murmured, &ldquo;What a lovely little
thing!&rdquo;&nbsp; By which, for truth&rsquo;s sake, it is to be
hoped she meant the lace-edged handkerchief.</p>
<p>In the exchange of civilities between the two women, the
respective children in their charge were admonished to kiss each
other,&mdash;a feat which was accomplished by Jan&rsquo;s kissing
the baby very tenderly, and with all his usual gravity.</p>
<p>As this partly awoke the baby from a doze, its red face began
to crease, and pucker, and twist into various contortions, at
which Jan gazed with a sort of solemn curiosity in his black
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stroke the little lady&rsquo;s cheeks, love,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Lake, irrepressibly proud of the winning ways and
quaint grace which certainly did distinguish her
foster-child.</p>
<p>Jan leaned forward once more, and passed his little hand
softly down the baby&rsquo;s face twice or thrice, as he was wont
to stroke the sandy kitten, as it slept with him, saying,
&ldquo;Poor itta pussy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a puss-cat, bless his little
heart!&rdquo; said the matter-of-fact nurse.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s little Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it, love!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake, adding, to the
nurse, &ldquo;he can say any thing, mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss <i>Am&mdash;abel Ad&mdash;e&mdash;line
Am&mdash;ma&mdash;by</i>,&rdquo; prompted the nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amabel!&rdquo; said the little Jan, softly.&nbsp; But,
after this feat, he took a fit of childish reticence, and would
say no more; whilst, deeply resentful of the liberties Jan had
taken, Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby twisted her features till she
looked like a gutta-percha gargoyle, and squalled as only a
fretful baby can squall.</p>
<p>She was calmed at last, however, and the windmiller took her
once more into his arms, and Mrs. Lake carrying Jan, they all
climbed up the narrow ladder to the next floor.</p>
<p>Heavily ground the huge stones with a hundred and twenty
revolutions a minute, making the chamber shake as they went
round.</p>
<p>They made the nurse giddy.&nbsp; The simplest machinery has a
bewildering effect upon an unaccustomed person.&nbsp; So has
going up a ladder; which makes you feel much less safe in the
place to which it leads you than if you had got there by a proper
flight of stairs.&nbsp; So&mdash;very often&mdash;has finding
yourself face to face with the accomplishment of what you have
been striving for, if you happen to be weak-minded.</p>
<p>Under the combined influences of all these causes, the nurse
listened nervously to Master Lake, as he did the honors of the
mill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those be the mill-stones, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Pretty
fastish they grinds, and they goes faster when the wind&rsquo;s
gusty.&nbsp; Many a good cat they&rsquo;ve ground as flat as a
pancake from the poor gawney beasts getting into the
hopper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; cried the nurse, now thoroughly
alarmed, &ldquo;give me the young lady back again.&nbsp; Deary,
deary me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d no notion it was so dangerous.&nbsp;
Oh, don&rsquo;t, sir! don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hold un safe,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the windmiller, who had all a
man&rsquo;s dislike for shirking at the last moment what had once
been decided upon; and, as the nurse afterwards expressed it,
before she had time to scream, he had tucked Miss Amabel Adeline
Ammaby&rsquo;s finery well round her, and had dipped her into the
hopper and out again.</p>
<p>In that moment of suspense both the women had been silent, and
the little Jan had gazed steadily at the operation.&nbsp; As it
safely ended, they both broke simultaneously into words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have knocked me down with a feather,
mum!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Lake.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t look,
mum.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t have looked to save my life.&nbsp; I
turned my back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d back &rsquo;ee allus to do the silliest thing
as could be done, missus,&rdquo; said the miller, who had a
pleasant husbandly way of commenting upon his wife&rsquo;s
conversation to her disparagement, when she talked before
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the nurse said, &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off the dear child&rsquo;s
hood.&nbsp; But move,&mdash;no thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t have moved hand or foot for a five-pound note,
paid upon the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baby got well.&nbsp; Whether the mill charm worked the
cure, or whether the fine fresh breezes of that healthy district
made a change for the better in the child&rsquo;s state, could
not be proved.</p>
<p>Nor were these the only possible causes of the recovery.</p>
<p>The kind-hearted butler blessed the day when he laid out three
and eightpence in a box of the bone-setter&rsquo;s ointment, to
such good purpose.</p>
<p>Lady Louisa&rsquo;s mamma triumphantly hoped that it would be
a lesson to her dear daughter never again to set a London
doctor&rsquo;s advice (however expensive) above a mother&rsquo;s
(she meant a grandmother&rsquo;s) experience.</p>
<p>The cook said, &ldquo;Goose-grease and kitchen physic for
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And of course the doctor very properly, as well as modestly,
observed that &ldquo;he had confidently anticipated permanent
beneficial results from a persevering use of the
embrocation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And only to the nurse and the windmiller&rsquo;s family was it
known that Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby had been dipped in the
mill-hopper.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">GENTRY
BORN.&mdash;LEARNING LOST.&mdash;JAN&rsquo;S
BEDFELLOW.&mdash;AMABEL.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the nurse and baby had left
the mill, Mrs. Lake showered extra caresses upon the little
Jan.&nbsp; It had given her a strange pleasure to see him in
contact with the Squire&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; She knew enough of
the manners and customs, the looks and the intelligence of the
children of educated parents, to be aware that there were
&ldquo;makings&rdquo; in those who were born heirs to developed
intellects, and the grace that comes of discipline, very
different from the &ldquo;makings&rdquo; to be found in the
&ldquo;voolish&rdquo; descendants of ill-nurtured and uneducated
generations.&nbsp; She had no philosophical&mdash;hardly any
reasonable or commendable&mdash;thoughts about it.&nbsp; But she
felt that Jan&rsquo;s countenance and his &ldquo;ways&rdquo;
justified her first belief that he was &ldquo;gentry
born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was proud of his pretty manners.&nbsp; Indeed, curiously
enough, she had recalled her old memories of nursery etiquette
under a first-rate upper nurse in &ldquo;her young days,&rdquo;
to apply them to the little Jan&rsquo;s training.</p>
<p>Why she had not done this with her own children is a question
that cannot perhaps be solved till we know why so many soldiers,
used for, it may be, a quarter of a century to personal
cleanliness as scrupulous as a gentleman&rsquo;s, and to enforced
neatness of clothes, rooms, and general habits, take back to dirt
and slovenliness with greediness when they leave the service; and
why many a nurse, whose voice and manners were beyond reproach in
her mistress&rsquo;s nursery, brings up her own children in after
life on the village system of bawling, banging, threatening,
cuddling, stuffing, smacking, and coarse language, just as if she
had never experienced the better discipline attainable by gentle
firmness and regular habits.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake had a small satisfaction in Jan&rsquo;s brief and
limited intercourse with so genteel a baby, and after it was all
over she amused herself with making him repeat the baby&rsquo;s
very genteel (and as she justly said &ldquo;uncommon&rdquo;)
name.</p>
<p>When Abel came back from school, he resumed his charge, and
Mrs. Lake went about other work.&nbsp; She was busy, and the
nurse-boy put Jan to bed himself.&nbsp; The sandy kitten waited
till Jan was fairly established, so as to receive her
comfortably, and then she dropped from the roof of the press-bed,
and he cuddled her into his arms, where she purred like a kettle
just beginning to sing.</p>
<p>Outside, the wind was rising, and, passing more or less
through the outer door, it roared in the round-house; but they
were well sheltered in the dwelling-room, and could listen
complacently to the gusts that whirled the sails, and made the
heavy stones fly round till they shook the roof.&nbsp; Just above
the press-bed a candle was stuck in the wall, and the dim light
falling through the gloom upon the children made a scene worthy
of the pencil of Rembrandt, that great son of a windmiller.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Lake found time to come to the corner where the old
press-bed stood, the kitten was asleep, and Jan very nearly so;
and by them sat Abel, watching every breath that his
foster-brother drew.&nbsp; And, as he watched, his trustworthy
eyes and most sweet smile lighting up a face to which his
forefathers had bequeathed little beauty or intellect, he might
have been the guardian angel of the nameless Jan, scarcely veiled
under the likeness of a child.</p>
<p>His mother smiled tenderly back upon him.&nbsp; He was very
dear to her, and not the less so for his tenderness to Jan.</p>
<p>Then she stooped to kiss her foster-child, who opened his
black eyes very wide, and caught the sleeping kitten round the
head, in the fear that it might be taken from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Abel the name of pretty young lady you see to-day,
love,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake.</p>
<p>But Jan was well aware of his power over the miller&rsquo;s
wife, and was apt to indulge in caprice.&nbsp; So he only shook
his head, and cuddled the kitten more tightly than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell un, Janny dear.&nbsp; Tell un, there&rsquo;s a
lovey!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who did daddy put in
the hopper?&rdquo;&nbsp; But still Jan gazed at nothing in
particular with a sly twinkle in his black eyes, and continued to
squeeze poor Sandy to a degree that can have been little less
agonizing than the millstone torture; and obdurate he would
probably have remained, but that Abel, bending over him, said,
&ldquo;Do &rsquo;ee tell poor Abel, Jan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child fixed his bright eyes steadily on Abel&rsquo;s
well-loved face for a few seconds, and then said quite clearly,
in soft, evenly accented syllables,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amabel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the sandy kitten, having escaped with its life, crept back
into Jan&rsquo;s bosom and purred itself to rest.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">ABEL AT HOME.&mdash;JAN
OBJECTS TO THE MILLER&rsquo;S MAN.&mdash;THE ALPHABET.&mdash;THE
CHEAP JACK.&mdash;&ldquo;PITCHERS.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Poor</span> Abel was not fated to get much
regular schooling.&nbsp; He particularly liked learning, but the
interval was all too brief between the time when his mother was
able to spare him from housework and the time when his father
began to employ him in the mill.</p>
<p>George got more lazy and stupid, instead of less so, and
though in some strange manner he kept his place, yet when Master
Lake had once begun to employ his son, he found that he would get
along but ill without him.</p>
<p>To Jan, Abel&rsquo;s being about the windmill gave the utmost
satisfaction.&nbsp; He played with his younger foster-brothers
and sisters contentedly enough, but his love for Abel, and for
being with Abel, was quite another thing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake, too, had no confidence in any one but Abel as a
nurse for her darling; the consequence of which was, that the
little Jan was constantly trotting at his foster-brother&rsquo;s
heels through the round-house, attempting valiant escalades on
the ladders, and covering himself from head to foot with flour in
the effort to cultivate a miller&rsquo;s thumb.</p>
<p>One day Mrs. Lake, having sent the other children off to
school, was bent upon having a thorough cleaning-out of the
dwelling-room, during which process Jan was likely to be in her
way; so she caught him up in her arms and went to seek Abel in
the round-house.</p>
<p>She had the less scruple in availing herself of his services,
that there was no wind, and business was not brisk in the
windmill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maester!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;can Abel mind Jan a
bit?&nbsp; I be going to clean the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the windmiller, &ldquo;Abel can
mind un.&nbsp; I be going to the village myself, but
there&rsquo;s Gearge to start, if so be the wind rises.&nbsp; And
then if he want Abel, thee must take the little un
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartinly I will,&rdquo; said his wife; and Abel
willingly received his charge and carried him off to play among
the sacks.</p>
<p>George joined them once, but Jan had a rooted and
unconquerable dislike to the miller&rsquo;s man, and never
replied to his advances with any thing more friendly than anger
or tears.&nbsp; This day was no exception to others in this
respect; and after a few fruitless attempts to make himself
acceptable, in the course of which he trod on the sandy
kitten&rsquo;s tail, who ran up Jan&rsquo;s back and spat at her
enemy from that vantage-ground, George went off muttering in
terms by no means complimentary to the little Jan.&nbsp; Abel did
his best to excuse the capricious child to George, besides
chiding him for his rudeness&mdash;with very little effect.&nbsp;
Jan dried his black eyes as the miller&rsquo;s man made off, but
he looked no more ashamed of himself than a good dog looks who
has growled or refused the paw of friendship to some one for
excellent reasons of his own.</p>
<p>After George had gone, they played about happily enough, Jan
riding on Abel&rsquo;s back, and the sandy kitten on Jan&rsquo;s,
in and out among the corn-sacks, full canter as far as the old
carved meal-chest, and back to the door again.</p>
<p>Poor Abel, with his double burden, got tired at last, and they
sat down and sifted flour for the education of their
thumbs.&nbsp; Jan was pinching and flattening his with a very
solemn face, in the hope of attaining to a miller&rsquo;s thumb
by a shorter process than the common one, when Abel suddenly
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell thee what, then, Jan: &rsquo;tis time thee
learned thy letters.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll teach thee.&nbsp; Come
hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan jumped up, thereby pitching the kitten headlong from his
shoulders, and ran to Abel, who was squatting by some spilled
flour near a sack, and was smoothing it upon the floor with his
hands.&nbsp; Then very slowly and carefully he traced the letter
A in the flour, keenly watched by Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s A,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say it,
Jan.&nbsp; A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A,&rdquo; replied Jan, obediently.&nbsp; But he had no
sooner said it, than, adding hastily, &ldquo;Let Jan do
it,&rdquo; he traced a second A, slightly larger than
Abel&rsquo;s, in three firm and perfectly proportioned
strokes.</p>
<p>His moving finger was too much for the kitten&rsquo;s
feelings, and she sprang into the flour and pawed both the
A&rsquo;s out of existence.</p>
<p>Jan slapped her vigorously, and having smoothed the surface
once more, he drew A after A with the greatest rapidity,
scrambling along sideways like a crab, and using both hands
indifferently, till the row stretched as far as the flour would
permit.</p>
<p>Abel&rsquo;s pride in his pupil was great, and he was fain to
run off to call his mother to see the performances of their
prodigy, but Jan was too impatient to spare him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Jan do more!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Abel traced a B in the flour.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s B,
Jan,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan do it,&rdquo; replied Jan, confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say it,&rdquo; said his teacher, restraining
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say B, Jan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;B,&rdquo; said Jan, impatiently; and adding, &ldquo;Jan
do it,&rdquo; he began a row of B&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He hesitated
slightly before making the second curve, and looked at his model,
after which he went down the line as before, and quite as
successfully.&nbsp; And the kitten went down also, pawing out
each letter as it was made, under the impression that the whole
affair was a game of play with herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There bean&rsquo;t a letter that bothers him,&rdquo;
cried Abel, triumphantly, to the no less triumphant
foster-mother.</p>
<p>Jan had, indeed, gone through the whole alphabet, with the
utmost ease and self-confidence; but his remembrance of the names
of the letters he drew so readily proved to be far less perfect
than his representations of them on the floor of the
round-house.</p>
<p>Abel found his pupil&rsquo;s progress hindered by the very
talent that he had displayed.&nbsp; He was so anxious to draw the
letters that he would not learn them, and Abel was at last
obliged to make one thing a condition of the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it then, Jan,&rdquo; he would cry, &ldquo;and then
thee shall make &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake commissioned Abel to buy a small slate and pencil
for Jan at the village shop, and these were now the child&rsquo;s
favorite toys.&nbsp; He would sit quiet for any length of time
with them.&nbsp; Even the sandy kitten was neglected, or got a
rap on its nose with the slate-pencil, when to toy with the
moving point had been too great a temptation to be
resisted.&nbsp; For a while Jan&rsquo;s taste for wielding the
pencil was solely devoted to furthering his learning to
read.&nbsp; He drew letters only till the day that the Cheap Jack
called.</p>
<p>The Cheap Jack was a travelling pedler, who did a good deal of
business in that neighborhood.&nbsp; He was not a pedler pure,
for he had a little shop in the next town.&nbsp; Nature had not
favored him.&nbsp; He was a hunchback.&nbsp; He was, or pretended
to be, deaf.&nbsp; He had a very ugly face, made uglier by dirt,
above which he wore a mangy hair cap.&nbsp; He sold rough
pottery, cheap crockery and glass, mock jewelry, low song-books,
framed pictures, mirrors, and quack medicines.&nbsp; He bought
old bottles, bones, and rags.&nbsp; And what else he bought or
sold, or dealt with, was dimly guessed at by a few, but fully
known to none.</p>
<p>Where he was born, what was his true name or age, whether on
any given occasion he was speaking less than lies, and what was
the ultimate object of his words and deeds,&mdash;at these things
no one even guessed.&nbsp; That his conscience was ever clean,
that his dirty face once masked no vile or petty plots for evil
in the brain behind, that at some past period he was a
child,&mdash;these things it would have tasked the strongest
faith to realize.</p>
<p>He was not so unpopular with children as the miller&rsquo;s
man.</p>
<p>The instinct of children is like the instinct of dogs, very
true and delicate as a rule.&nbsp; But dogs, from Cerberus
downwards, are liable to be biassed by sops.&nbsp; And four
paper-covered sails, that twirl upon the end of a stick as the
wind blows, would warp the better judgment of most little boys,
especially (for a bargain is more precious than a gift) when the
thing is to be bought for a few old bones.</p>
<p>Jan was a little afraid of the Cheap Jack, but he liked his
whirligigs.&nbsp; They went when the mill was going, and
sometimes when the mill wouldn&rsquo;t go, if you ran hard to
make a breeze.</p>
<p>But it so happened that the first day on which the Cheap Jack
came round after Jan had begun to learn his letters, he brought
forth some wares which moved Jan&rsquo;s feelings more than the
whirligigs did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy a nice picter, marm?&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack to
Mrs. Lake, who, with the best intentions not to purchase, felt
that there could be no harm in seeing what the man had got.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have &lsquo;Joseph and his Bretheren&rsquo;
cheap,&rdquo; roared the hunchback, becoming more pressing as the
windmiller&rsquo;s wife seemed slow to be fascinated, and shaking
&ldquo;Joseph and his Brethren,&rdquo; framed in satin-wood, in
her face, as he advanced upon her with an almost threatening
air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em?&nbsp; Take
&lsquo;Antony and Cleopatterer.&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sweet
picter.&nbsp; Too dear?&nbsp; Do you know what sech picters costs
to paint?&nbsp; Look at Cleopatterer&rsquo;s dress and the jewels
she has on.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t make a farthing on
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; I gets daily bread out of the other things, and
only keeps the picters to oblige one or two ladies of taste that
likes to give their rooms a genteel appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The long disuse of such powers of judgment as she had, and
long habit of always giving way, had helped to convert Mrs.
Lake&rsquo;s naturally weak will and unselfish disposition into a
sort of mental pulp, plastic to any pressure from without.&nbsp;
To men she invariably yielded; and, poor specimen of a man as the
Cheap Jack was, she had no fibre of personal judgment or decision
in the strength of which to oppose his assertions, and every
instant she became more and more convinced that wares she neither
wanted nor approved of were necessary to her, and good bargains,
because the man who sold them said so.</p>
<p>The Cheap Jack was a knave, but he was no fool.&nbsp; In a
crowded market-place, or at a street door, no oilier tongue
wagged than his.&nbsp; But he knew exactly the moment when a
doubtful bargain might be clinched by a bullying tone and a
fierce look on his dirty face, at cottage doors, on heaths or
downs, when the good wife was alone with her children, and the
nearest neighbor was half a mile away.</p>
<p>No length of experience taught Mrs. Lake wisdom in reference
to the Cheap Jack.</p>
<p>Each time that his cart appeared in sight she resolved to have
nothing to do with him, warned by the latest cracked jug, or the
sugar-basin which, after three-quarters of an hour wasted in
chaffering, she had beaten down to three-halfpence dearer than
what she afterwards found to be the shop price in the town.&nbsp;
But proof to the untrained mind is &ldquo;as water spilled upon
the ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when the Cheap Jack declared that
she was quite free to look without buying, and that he did not
want her to buy, Mrs. Lake allowed him to pull down his goods as
before, and listened to his statements as if she had never proved
them to be lies, and was thrown into confusion and fluster when
he began to bully, and bought in haste to be rid of him, and
repented at leisure&mdash;to no purpose as far as the future was
concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; yelled the hunchback, as he waddled
with horrible swiftness after the miller&rsquo;s wife, as she
withdrew into the mill; &ldquo;which do you mean to have?&nbsp;
<i>I</i> gets nothing on &rsquo;em, whichever you takes, so
please yourself.&nbsp; Take &lsquo;Joseph and his
Bretheren.&rsquo;&nbsp; The frame&rsquo;s worth twice the
money.&nbsp; Take the other, too, and I&rsquo;ll take sixpence
off the pair, and be out of pocket to please you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to-day, thank you!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake, as
loudly as she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any other sort, you say?&rdquo; said the Cheap
Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got all sorts, but some parties is
so difficult to please.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, wait a bit,&rdquo; he continued, as Mrs.
Lake again tried to make him (willing to) hear that she wanted
none of his wares; and, vanishing with the uncanny quickness
common to him, he waddled swiftly back again to his cart, and
returned, before Mrs. Lake could secure herself from intrusion,
laden with a fresh supply of pictures, the weight of which it
seemed marvellous that he could support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve got your choice, marm,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trouble to me to oblige a good
customer.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s picters for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pitchers</i>!&rdquo; said Jan, admiringly, as he
crept up to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are, my little man.&nbsp; Now then, help your
mammy to choose.&nbsp; Most of these is things you can&rsquo;t
get now, for love nor money.&nbsp; Here you
are,&mdash;&lsquo;Love and Beauty.&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a
sweet thing.&nbsp; &lsquo;St Joseph,&rsquo; &lsquo;The
Robber&rsquo;s Bride,&rsquo; &lsquo;Child and Lamb,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Melan-choly.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s an
old&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pitcher!&rdquo; exclaimed Jan once more, gazing at an
old etching in a dirty frame, which the Cheap Jack was holding in
his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pitcher, pitcher! let Jan look!&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>It was of a water-mill, old, thatched, and with an unprotected
wheel, like the one in the valley below.&nbsp; Some gnarled
willows stretched across the water, whose trunks seemed hardly
less time-worn and rotten than the wheel below.&nbsp; This
foreground subject was in shadow, and strongly drawn, but beyond
it, in the sunlight, lay a bit of delicate distance, on the
rising ground of which stood one of those small wooden windmills
known as Post-mills.&nbsp; An old woman and a child were just
coming into the shade, and passing beneath a wayside
shrine.&nbsp; What in the picture took Jan&rsquo;s fancy it is
impossible to say, but he gazed at it with exclamations of
delight.</p>
<p>The Cheap Jack saw that it was certain to be bought, and he
raised the price accordingly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake felt the same conviction, and began to try at least
to get a good bargain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a terr&rsquo;ble old frame,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;There be no gold left on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And no more there was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; screamed the Cheap Jack, with
his hand to his ear, and both a great deal too close to Mrs.
Lake&rsquo;s face to be pleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis such an old frame,&rdquo; she shouted,
&ldquo;and the gold be all gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old!&rdquo; cried the hunchback, scowling; &ldquo;who
says I sell old things?&nbsp; Every picter in that lot&rsquo;s
brand new and dirt cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gold be rubbed off,&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Lake in
his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brighten it up, then,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gold ain&rsquo;t paint; gold ain&rsquo;t paper; rub it
up!&rdquo; and, suiting the action to the word, he rubbed the
dirty old frame vigorously with the dirty sleeve of his
smock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t seem to brighten it, nohow,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Lake, looking nervously round; but neither the miller nor
George was to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real gold allus looks like this in damp weather,&rdquo;
said the Cheap Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hang it up in a warm room, dust
it lightly every morning with a dry handkerchief, an&rsquo;
it&rsquo;ll come out that shining you&rsquo;ll see your face in
it.&nbsp; And when summer comes, cover it up in yaller gauze to
keep off the flies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake looked wistfully at the place the Cheap Jack had
rubbed, but she had no redress, and saw no way out of her hobble
but to buy the picture.</p>
<p>When the bargain was completed, the Cheap Jack fell back into
his oiliest manner; it being part of his system not only to bully
at the critical moment, but to be very civil afterwards, so as to
leave an impression so pleasant on the minds of his lady
customers that they could hardly do other than thank him for his
promise to call again shortly with &ldquo;bargains as good as
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cheap Jack was a man of many voices.&nbsp; The softness of
his parting words to Mrs. Lake, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go three mile
out of my road, ma&rsquo;am, to call on a lady like you,&rdquo;
had hardly died away, when he woke the echoes of the plains by
addressing his horse in a very different tone.</p>
<p>The Wiltshire carters and horses have a language between them
which falls darkly upon the ear of the unlearned therein; but the
uncouth yell which the Cheap Jack addressed to his beast was not
of that dialect.&nbsp; The sound he made on this occasion was
not, Ga oot!&nbsp; Coom hedder! or, There right! but the horse
understood it.</p>
<p>It is probable that it never heard the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
softer intonations, for its protuberant bones gave a quiver
beneath the scarred skin as he yelled.&nbsp; Then its drooping
ears pricked faintly, the quavering forelegs were braced, one
desperate jog of the tottering load of oddities, and it set
slowly and silently forward.</p>
<p>The Cheap Jack did not follow his wares; he scrambled softly
round the mill, like a deformed cat, looking about him on all
sides.&nbsp; Then he made use of another sound,&mdash;a sharp,
suggestive sound, whistled between two of his fingers.</p>
<p>Then he looked round again.</p>
<p>No one appeared.&nbsp; The wheels of the distant cart scraped
slowly along the road, but this was the only sound the Cheap Jack
heard.</p>
<p>He whistled softly again.</p>
<p>And as the cart took the sharp turn of the road, and was lost
to sight, the miller&rsquo;s man appeared, and the Cheap Jack
greeted him in the softest tone he had yet employed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, there you are, my dear!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Lake sat within, and looked ruefully at the
damaged frame, and wished that the master, or at least the man,
had happened to be at home.</p>
<p>It is to be feared that our self-reproach for having done
wrong is not always so certain, or so keen, as our self-reproach
for having allowed ourselves to suffer wrong&mdash;in a bad
bargain.</p>
<p>Whether this particular picture was a bad bargain it is not
easy to decide.</p>
<p>It was scandalously dear for its condition, and for what it
had cost the hunchback, but it was cheap for the pleasure it gave
to the little Jan.</p>

77</span>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">SCARECROWS AND
MEN.&mdash;JAN REFUSES TO &ldquo;MAKE
GEARGE.&rdquo;&mdash;UNCANNY.&mdash;&ldquo;JAN&rsquo;S
OFF.&rdquo;-THE MOON AND THE CLOUDS.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> picture gave Jan great
pleasure, but it proved a stumbling-block on the road to
learning.</p>
<p>To &ldquo;make letters&rdquo; on his slate had been the utmost
of his ambition, and as he made them he learned them.&nbsp; But
after the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s visit his constant cry was,
&ldquo;Jan make pitchers.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when Abel tried to
confine his attention to the alphabet, he would, after a most
perfunctory repetition of a few letters that he knew, and
hap-hazard blunders over fresh ones, fling his arms round
Abel&rsquo;s neck and say coaxingly, &ldquo;Abel dear, make Janny
<i>pitchers</i> on his slate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abel&rsquo;s pictures, at the best, were of that style of wall
decoration dear to street boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a pitcher of a man,&rdquo; Jan would cry.&nbsp;
And Abel did so, bit by bit, to Jan&rsquo;s dictation.&nbsp; Thus
&ldquo;Make&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Make un round.&nbsp; Make two
eyes.&nbsp; Make a nose.&nbsp; Make a mouth.&nbsp; Make&rsquo;s
arms.&nbsp; Make&rsquo;s fingers,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; And, with
some &ldquo;free-handling,&rdquo; Abel would strike the five
fingers off, one by one, in five screeching strokes of the
slate-pencil.&nbsp; But his art was conventional, and when Jan
said, &ldquo;Make un a miller&rsquo;s thumb,&rdquo; he was
puzzled, and could only bend the shortest of the five strokes
slightly backwards to represent the trade-mark of his
forefathers.</p>
<p>And when a little later Jan said one day, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a
galley crow, that is.&nbsp; <i>Now</i> make a pitcher of a <span
class="GutSmall">MAN</span>, Abel dear!&rdquo; Abel found that
the scarecrow figure was the limit of his artist powers, and
thenceforward it was Jan who &ldquo;made pitchers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew from dawn to dusk upon the little slate which he wore
tied by a bit of string to the belt of his pinafore.&nbsp; He
drew his foster-mother, and Abel, and the kitten, and the clock,
and the flower-pots in the window, and the windmill itself, and
every thing he saw or imagined.&nbsp; And he drew till his slate
was full on both sides, and then in very primitive fashion he
spat and rubbed it all out and began again.&nbsp; And whenever
Jan&rsquo;s face was washed, the two faces of his slate were
washed too; and with this companion he was perfectly happy and
constantly employed.</p>
<p>Now it was Abel who gave the subjects for the pictures, and
Jan who made them, and it was good Abel also who washed the
slate, and rubbed the well-worn stumps of pencil to new points
upon the round-house floor.</p>
<p>They often went together to a mound at some little distance,
where, seated side by side, they &ldquo;made a mill&rdquo; upon
the slate, Jan drawing, and Abel dictating the details to be
recorded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put in the window, Jan,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;and
another, and another, and another, and another.&nbsp; Now put the
sails.&nbsp; Now put the stage.&nbsp; Now put daddy by the
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one point Jan was obstinate.&nbsp; He steadily refused to
&ldquo;make Gearge&rdquo; upon his slate in any capacity
whatever.&nbsp; Perhaps it was in this habit of constantly gazing
at all things about him, in order to commit them to his slate,
which gave a strange, dreamy expression to Jan&rsquo;s dark
eyes.&nbsp; Perhaps it was sky-gazing, or the windmiller&rsquo;s
trick of watching the clouds, or perhaps it was something else,
from which Jan derived an erectness of carriage not common among
the children about him, and a quaint way of carrying his little
chin in the air as if he were listening to voices from a higher
level than that of the round-house floor.</p>
<p>If he had lived farther north, he could hardly have escaped
the suspicion of uncanniness.&nbsp; He was strangely like a
changeling among the miller&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>To gratify that old whim of his about the red shawl, his
doting foster-mother made him little crimson frocks; and as he
wandered over the downs in his red dress and a white pinafore,
his yellow hair flying in the breeze, his chin up, his black eyes
wide open, with slate in one hand, his pencil in the other, and
the sandy kitten clinging to his shoulder (for Jan never lowered
his chin to help her to balance herself), he looked more like
some elf than a child of man.</p>
<p>He had queer, independent ways of his own, too;
freaks,&mdash;not naughty enough for severe punishment, but
sufficiently out of the routine and unexpected to cause Mrs. Lake
some trouble.</p>
<p>He was no sooner firmly established on his own legs, with the
power of walking, or rather toddling, independent of help, than
he took to making expeditions on the downs by himself.&nbsp; He
would watch his opportunity, and when his foster-mother&rsquo;s
back was turned, and the door of the round-house opened by some
grist-bringer, he would slip out and toddle off with a swiftness
decidedly dangerous to a balance so lately acquired.</p>
<p>Sometimes Mrs. Lake would catch sight of him, and if her hands
were in the wash-tub, or otherwise engaged, she would cry to the
nurse-boy, &ldquo;Abel, he be off!&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s
off.&rdquo;&nbsp; A comic result of which was that Jan generally
announced his own departure in the same words, though not always
loud enough to bring detection upon himself.</p>
<p>When his chance came and the door was open, he would pause for
half a moment on the threshold to say, in a tone of intense
self-satisfaction, &ldquo;He be off.&nbsp; Abel!&nbsp;
Janny&rsquo;s off!&rdquo; and forthwith toddle out as hard as he
could go.&nbsp; As he grew older, he dropped this form; but the
elfish habit of appearing and disappearing at his own whim was
not cured.</p>
<p>It was a puzzle as well as a care to Mrs. Lake.&nbsp; All her
own children had given trouble in their own way,&mdash;a way much
the same with all of them.&nbsp; They squalled for what they
wanted, and, like other mothers of her class, she served them
whilst her patience lasted, and slapped them when it came to an
end.&nbsp; They clung about her when she was cooking, in company
with the cats, and she put tit-bits into their dirty paws, and
threw scraps to the clean paws of the cats, till the nuisance
became overwhelming, and she kicked the cats and slapped the
children, who squalled for both.&nbsp; They dirted their clothes,
they squabbled, they tore the gathers out of her dresses, and
wailed and wept, and were beaten with a hazel-stick by their
father, and pacified with treacle-stick by the mother; and so
tumbled up, one after the other, through childish customs and
misdemeanors, almost as uniform as the steps of the
mill-ladders.</p>
<p>But the customs and misdemeanors of the foster-child were very
different.</p>
<p>His appetite to be constantly eating, drinking, or
sucking&mdash;if it were but a bennet or grass-stalk&mdash;was
less voracious than that of the other children.&nbsp; Mrs. Lake
gave him Benjamin&rsquo;s share of treacle-stick, but he has been
known to give some of it away, and to exchange peppermint-drops
for a slate-pencil rather softer than his own.&nbsp; He would
have had Benjamin&rsquo;s share of &ldquo;bits&rdquo; from the
cupboard, but that the other children begged so much oftener, and
Mrs. Lake was not capable of refusing any thing to a steady
tease.&nbsp; He could walk the whole length of a turnip-field
without taking a munch, unless he were hungry, though even dear
old Abel invariably exercised his jaws upon a
&ldquo;turmut.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he made himself ill with
hedge-fruits and ground-roots seldomer than any other member of
the family.</p>
<p>So far, Jan gave less trouble than the rest.&nbsp; But then he
had a spirit of enterprise which never misled them.&nbsp; From
the effects of this, Abel saved his life more than once.&nbsp; On
one occasion he pulled him out of the wash-tub, into which he had
plunged head-foremost, in a futile endeavor to blow soap-bubbles
through a fragment of clay-pipe, which he had picked up on the
road, and which made his lips sore for a week, besides nearly
causing his death by drowning.</p>
<p>From diving into the deepest recesses of the windmill it
became hopeless to try to hinder him, and when Abel was fairly
taken into the business Mrs. Lake relied upon his care for his
foster-brother.&nbsp; And Jan was wary and nimble, for his own
part, and gave little trouble.&nbsp; His great delight was to
gaze first out of one window, and then out of the opposite one;
either blinking as the great sails drove by, as if they would
strike him in the face, or watching the shadows of them
invisible, as they passed like noon-day ghosts over the
grass.</p>
<p>His habit of taking himself off on solitary expeditions
neither the miller&rsquo;s hazel-stick nor Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s
treacle-stick could cure by force or favor.</p>
<p>One November evening, just after tea, Jan disappeared, and the
yellow kitten also.&nbsp; When his bed-time came, Mrs. Lake
sought him high and low, and Abel went carefully,
mill-candlestick in hand, through every floor, from the
millstones to the machinery, but in vain.&nbsp; Neither he nor
the kitten was to be found.</p>
<p>It was when the kitten, in chase of her own tail, tumbled in
sideways through the round-house door, that Mrs. Lake remembered
that Jan might possibly have gone out, and she ran out after
him.</p>
<p>The air was chill and fresh, but not bitterly cold.&nbsp; The
moon rode high in the dark heavens, and a flock of small white
clouds passed slowly before its face and spread over the
sky.&nbsp; The shadows of the driving sails fell clearly in the
moonlight, and flitted over the grass more quickly than the
clouds went by the moon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake was not susceptible to effects of scenery, and she
was thinking of Jan.&nbsp; As she ran round the windmill, she
struck her foot against what proved to be his body, and,
stooping, saw that he was lying on his face.&nbsp; But when she
snatched him up with a cry of terror, she found that he was not
dead, nor even hurt, but only weeping pettishly.</p>
<p>In the first revulsion of feeling from her fright, she was
rather disposed to shake her recovered treasure, as a relief to
her own excitement.&nbsp; But Abel, whose first sight of Jan was
as the light of the mill-candle fell on his tear-stained face,
said tenderly, &ldquo;What be amiss, Janny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan can&rsquo;t make un,&rdquo; sobbed his
foster-brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can&rsquo;t Janny make?&nbsp; Tell Abel,
then,&rdquo; said the nurse-boy.</p>
<p>Jan stuck his fists into his eyes, which were drying fast, and
replied, &ldquo;Jan can&rsquo;t make the moon and the clouds,
Abel dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Abel&rsquo;s candle being at that moment blown out by a
gust of wind, he could see Jan&rsquo;s slate and pencil lying at
some distance apart upon the short grass.</p>
<p>On the dark ground of the slate he had made a round, white,
full moon with his soft slate-pencil, and had tried hard to draw
each cloud as it passed.&nbsp; But the rapid changes had baffled
him, and the pencil-marks were gray compared with the whiteness
of the clouds and the brightness of the moon, and the slate,
though dark, was a mockery of the deep, deep depths of the
night-sky.</p>
<p>And in his despair he had flung the slate one way and the
pencil another, and there they lay under the moonlight; and the
sandy kitten, who could see more clearly on this occasion than
any one else, was dancing a fandango upon poor Jan&rsquo;s
unfinished sketch.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE WHITE
HORSE.&mdash;COMROGUES.&mdash;MOERDYK.&mdash;GEORGE CONFIDES IN
THE CHEAP JACK&mdash;WITH RESERVATION.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s horse
came to the brow of the hill, it stopped, and with drooping neck
stood still as before.&nbsp; The Cheap Jack was busy with George,
and it was at no word from him that the poor beast paused.&nbsp;
It knew at what point to wait, and it waited.&nbsp; There was
little temptation to go on.&nbsp; The road down the hill had just
been mended with flints; some of these were the size of an
average turnip, and the hill was steep.&nbsp; So the old horse
poked out his nose, and stood almost dozing, till the sound of
the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s shuffling footsteps caused him to prick
his ears, and brace his muscles for a fresh start.</p>
<p>The miller&rsquo;s man came also, who was sulky, whilst the
Cheap Jack was civil.&nbsp; He gave his horse a cut across the
knees, to remind him to plant his feet carefully among the sharp
boulders; and then, choosing a smooth bit by the side of the
road, he and George went forward together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve took to picters, I see,&rdquo; said
George, nodding towards the cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have, my dear,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack;
&ldquo;any thing for a livelihood; an <i>honest</i> livelihood,
you know, George.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he winked at the
miller&rsquo;s man, who relaxed his sulkiness for a guffaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve</i> had so little in my way lately,
George,&rdquo; the hunchback continued, looking sharply sideways
up at his companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sly business has been slack, my
dear, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But George made no answer, and the Cheap Jack, after relieving
his feelings by another cut at the horse, changed the
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sharp little brat of the
miller&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said he, alluding to Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
he ain&rsquo;t much like the others.&nbsp; Old-fashioned,
too.&nbsp; Children mostly likes the gay picters, and worrits
their mothers for &rsquo;em, bless &rsquo;em!&nbsp; But he picked
out an ancient-looking thing,&mdash;came from a bankrupt
pawnshop, my dear, in a lot.&nbsp; I almost think I let it go too
cheap; but that&rsquo;s my failing.&nbsp; And a beggarly place
like this ain&rsquo;t like London.&nbsp; In London there&rsquo;s
a place for every thing, my dear, and shops for old goods as well
as new, and customers too; and the older and dirtier some things
is, the more they fetches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, for George did not speak; and the Cheap
Jack, bent upon amiability, repeated his remark,&mdash;&ldquo;A
sharp little brat, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be &rsquo;ee harping on about him for?&rdquo;
asked George, suspiciously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knows what I knows
about un, but that&rsquo;s no business of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know about most things, my dear,&rdquo; said the
Cheap Jack, flatteringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to get
up very early that catch you napping.&nbsp; But what about the
child, George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he
ain&rsquo;t none of the miller&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;ee
that; and he ain&rsquo;t the missus&rsquo;s neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he to <i>you</i>, my dear?&rdquo; asked the
dwarf, curiously, and, getting no answer, he went on:
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be useful in a good many lines.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;d not do bad in a circus, but he&rsquo;d draw prime as a
young prodigy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George looked round, &ldquo;You be thinking of stealing
<i>he</i> then, as well as&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, my dear,&rdquo; said the dwarf.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
no, I don&rsquo;t want him.&nbsp; But there was a good deal of
snatching young kids done in my young days; for sweeps, destitute
orphans, juvenile performers, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> wouldn&rsquo;t suit you,&rdquo; grinned
George.&nbsp; &ldquo;A comes of genteel folk, and a&rsquo;s not
hard enough for how you&rsquo;d treat un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out there, George,&rdquo; said the
dwarf.&nbsp; &ldquo;Human beings is like &rsquo;osses; it&rsquo;s
the genteelest as stands the most.&nbsp; &rsquo;Specially if
they&rsquo;ve been well fed when they was babies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point the Cheap Jack was interrupted by his horse
stumbling over a huge, jagged lump of flint, that, with the rest
of the road-mending, was a disgrace to a highway of a civilized
country.&nbsp; A rate-payer or a horse-keeper might have been
excused for losing his temper with the authorities of the
road-mending department; but the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wrath fell
upon his horse.&nbsp; He beat him over the knees for stumbling,
and across the hind legs for slipping, and over his face for
wincing, and accompanied his blows with a torrent of abuse.</p>
<p>What a moment that must have been for Balaam&rsquo;s ass, in
which she found voice to remonstrate against the unjust blows,
which have, nevertheless, fallen pretty thickly ever since upon
her descendants and their fellow-servants of ungrateful
man!&nbsp; From how many patient eyes that old reproach, of long
service ill-requited, yet speaks almost as plainly as the voice
that &ldquo;rebuked the madness of the prophet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cheap Jack&rsquo;s white horse had a point of resemblance
to the &ldquo;genteel human beings&rdquo; of whom he had been
speaking.&nbsp; It had &ldquo;come of a good stock,&rdquo; and
had seen better and kinder days; and to it, also, in its
misfortunes, there remained that nobility of spirit which rises
in proportion to the ills it meets with.&nbsp; The poor old thing
was miserably weak, and sore and jaded, and the flints were
torture.&nbsp; But it rallied its forces, gave a desperate
struggle, and got the cart safely to the bottom of the
hill.&nbsp; Here the road turned sharply, and the horse went
on.&nbsp; But after a few paces it stopped as before; this time
in front of a small public-house, where trembling, and bathed in
perspiration, it waited for its master.</p>
<p>The public-house was a small dark, dingy-looking hovel, with a
reputation fitted to its appearance.</p>
<p>A dirty, grim-looking man nodded to the Cheap Jack and George
as they entered, and a girl equally dirty, but much handsomer,
brought glasses of spirits, to which the friends applied
themselves, at the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp; George grew
more sociable, and the Cheap Jack reproached him with want of
confidence in his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so precious sharp, my dear,&rdquo; said
the hunchback, who knew well on what point George liked to be
flattered, &ldquo;that you overreaches yourself.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t complain&mdash;after all the business we&rsquo;ve
done together&mdash;that it&rsquo;s turned slack all of a
sudden.&nbsp; You says they&rsquo;re down on you, and
that&rsquo;s enough for me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t complain that
you&rsquo;ve got your own plans and keeps &rsquo;em as secret as
the grave, but I says you&rsquo;ll regret it.&nbsp; If you was a
good scholar, George, you could do without friends, you&rsquo;re
so precious sharp.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re no scholar, my dear,
and you&rsquo;ll be let in yet, by a worse friend than Cheap
John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George so bitterly regretted his want of common learning, and
the stupidity which made him still slow to decipher print, and
utterly puzzled by writing, that the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s remarks
told strongly.&nbsp; These, and the conversation they had had on
the hill, recalled to his mind a matter which was still a mystery
to the miller&rsquo;s man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Jack,&rdquo; said he, leaning across the
dirty little table; &ldquo;if you be such a good scholar, what do
M O E R D Y K spell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it again, George,&rdquo; said the dwarf.&nbsp; But
when, after that, he still looked puzzled, George laughed long
and loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be a good scholar!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You be a fine friend, too, for a iggerant man.&nbsp; If a
can&rsquo;t tell the first word of a letter, &rsquo;tis likely
&rsquo;ee could read the whole, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first word of a <i>letter</i>, eh?&rdquo; said the
dwarf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very first,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a long way you&rsquo;d get in it, and stuck at
the start!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up in the corner, at the top, eh?&rdquo; said the
dwarf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it be,&rdquo; said George, and he laughed no
longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the name of a place, then,&rdquo; said the
Cheap Jack; &ldquo;and it ain&rsquo;t to be expected I should
know the names of all the places in the world, George, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a great triumph for the Cheap Jack, as George&rsquo;s
face betrayed.&nbsp; If George had trusted him a little more, he
might have known the meaning of the mysterious word years
ago.&nbsp; The name of a place!&nbsp; The place from which the
letter was written.&nbsp; The place where something might be
learned about the writer of the letter, and of the gentleman to
whom it was written.&nbsp; For George knew so much.&nbsp; It was
written to a gentleman, and to a gentleman who had money, and who
had secrets; and, therefore, a gentleman from whom money might be
got, by interfering in his secrets.</p>
<p>The miller&rsquo;s man was very ignorant and very stupid, in
spite of a certain low cunning not at all incompatible with gross
ignorance.&nbsp; He had no knowledge of the world.&nbsp; His very
knowledge of malpractices and mischief was confined to the evil
doings of one or two other ill-conditioned country lads like
himself, who robbed their neighbors on dark nights, and disposed
of the spoil by the help of such men as the Cheap Jack and the
landlord of the public-house at the bottom of the hill.</p>
<p>But by loitering about on that stormy night years ago, when he
should have been attending to the mill, he had picked up enough
to show him that the strange gentleman had no mind to have his
proceedings as to the little Jan generally known.&nbsp; This and
some sort of traditional idea that &ldquo;sharp,&rdquo; though
penniless men had at times wrung a great deal of money from rich
people, by threatening to betray their secrets, was the sole
foundation of George&rsquo;s hopes in connection with the
letter.&nbsp; It was his very ignorance which hindered him from
seeing the innumerable chances against his getting to know any
thing important enough, even if he could use his information, to
procure a bribe.</p>
<p>He had long given up the idea as hopeless, though he had kept
the letter, but it revived when the Cheap Jack solved the puzzle
which Abel could not explain, and George finally promised to let
his friend read the whole letter for him.&nbsp; He also allowed
that it concerned Jan, or that he supposed it to do so.&nbsp; He
related Jan&rsquo;s history, and confessed that he had picked up
the letter, which was being blown about near the mill, on the
night of Jan&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>In this statement there was some truth, and some falsehood;
for in the opinion of the miller&rsquo;s man, if your own
interest obliged you to confide in a friend, it was at least wise
to hedge the confidence by not telling all the truth, or by
qualifying it with lies.</p>
<p>This mental process was, however, at least equally familiar to
the Cheap Jack, and he did not hesitate, in his own mind, to feel
sure that the letter had not been found, but stolen.&nbsp; In
which he was farther from the truth than if he had simply
believed George.</p>
<p>But then he was not in the neighborhood five years back, and,
as it happened, he had never heard of the lost pocket-book.</p>

MAN.&mdash;SAL.&mdash;THE &ldquo;WHITE HORSE.&rdquo;&mdash;THE
WEDDING.&mdash;THE WINDMILLER&rsquo;S WIFE FORGETS, AND REMEMBERS
TOO LATE.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Excitement</span>, the stifling atmosphere
of the public-house, and the spirits he had drunk at his
friend&rsquo;s expense, had somewhat confused the brains of the
miller&rsquo;s man by the time that the Cheap Jack rose to
go.&nbsp; George was, as a rule, sober beyond the wont of the
rustics of the district, chiefly from parsimony.&nbsp; When he
could drink at another man&rsquo;s expense, he was not always
prudent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve settled to go, my dear?&rdquo; said the
dwarf, as they stood together by the cart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Business
being slack, and parties unpleasantly suspicious, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; said George, who felt very
foolish, and hoped himself successful in looking very wise;
&ldquo;I be going to set up for myself; I&rsquo;m tired of
slaving for another man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, too,&rdquo; said the dwarf; &ldquo;but all
businesses takes money, of which, my dear, I doesn&rsquo;t doubt
you&rsquo;ve plenty.&nbsp; You always took care of Number One,
when you did business with Cheap John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, George felt himself a sort of embodiment of
shrewd wisdom; he had taken another sip from the glass, which was
still in his hand, and the only drawback to the sense of
magnified cunning by which his ideas seemed to be illumined was a
less pleasant feeling that they were perpetually slipping from
his grasp.&nbsp; To the familiar idea of outwitting the Cheap
Jack he held fast, however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be nothin&rsquo; to thee what a have,&rdquo; he said
slowly; &ldquo;but a don&rsquo;t mind &rsquo;ee knowin&rsquo; so
much, Jack, because &rsquo;ee can&rsquo;t get at un; haw,
haw!&nbsp; Not unless &rsquo;ee robs the savings-bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarf&rsquo;s eyes twinkled, and he affected to secure
some pictures that hung low, as he said carelessly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Savings-banks be good places for a poor man to lay by
in.&nbsp; They takes small sums, and a few shillings comes in
useful to a honest man, George, my dear, if they doesn&rsquo;t go
far in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shillings!&rdquo; cried George, indignantly;
&ldquo;pounds!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, doubtful if he had not said
too much, he added, &ldquo;A don&rsquo;t so much mind &rsquo;ee
knowing, Jack, because &rsquo;ee can&rsquo;t get at
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you&rsquo;re such a poor scholar,
George,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack, turning round, and looking
full at his friend; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re so sharp, but for that,
my dear.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t think you counts the money over in
your head till you makes it out more than it is, now,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A can keep things in my yead,&rdquo; said George,
&ldquo;better than most folks can keep a book; I knows what I
has, and what other folks can&rsquo;t get at.&nbsp; I knows how I
put un in.&nbsp; First, the five-pound bill&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have stared to see you bring five pound in a
lump, George, my dear!&rdquo; said the hunchback.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Was it wise, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gearge bean&rsquo;t such a vool as a looks,&rdquo;
replied the miller&rsquo;s man.&nbsp; &ldquo;A took good care to
change it first, Cheap John, and a put it in by bits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a clever customer, George,&rdquo; said his
friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, my dear?&nbsp; First, the five-pound
bill, and then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>George looked puzzled, and then, suddenly, angry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What be that to you?&rdquo; he asked, and forthwith
relapsed into a sulky fit, from which the Cheap Jack found it
impossible to rouse him.&nbsp; All attempts to renew the subject,
or to induce the miller&rsquo;s man to talk at all, proved
fruitless.&nbsp; The Cheap Jack insisted, however, on taking a
friendly leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, my dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;till the
mop.&nbsp; You knows my place in the town, and I shall expect
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miller&rsquo;s man only replied by a defiant nod, which
possibly meant that he would come, but had some appearance of
expressing only a sarcastic wish that the Cheap Jack might see
him on the occasion alluded to.</p>
<p>In obedience to a yell from its master, the white horse now
started forward, and it is not too much to say that the journey
to town was not made more pleasant for the poor beast by the fact
that the Cheap Jack had a good deal of long-suppressed fury to
vent upon somebody.</p>
<p>It was perhaps well for the bones of the white horse that,
just as they entered the town, the Cheap Jack brushed against a
woman on the narrow foot-path, who having turned to remonstrate
in no very civil terms, suddenly checked herself, and said in a
low voice, &ldquo;Juggling Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarf started, and looked at the woman with a puzzled
air.</p>
<p>She was a middle-aged woman, in the earlier half of middle
age; she was shabbily dressed, and had a face that would not have
been ill-looking, but that the upper lip was long and cleft, and
the lower one unusually large.&nbsp; As the Cheap Jack still
stared in silence, she burst into a noisy laugh, saying,
&ldquo;More know Jack the Fool than Jack the Fool
knows.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, even as she spoke, a gleam of
recognition suddenly spread over the hunchback&rsquo;s face, and,
putting out his hand, he said, &ldquo;Sal! <i>you here</i>, my
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air of London don&rsquo;t agree with me just
now,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;and how are you,
Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The country air&rsquo;s just beginning to disagree with
me, my dear,&rdquo; said the hunchback; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m glad
to see you, Sal.&nbsp; Come in here, my dear, and let&rsquo;s
have a talk, and a little refreshment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The place of refreshment to which the dwarf alluded was
another public-house, the White Horse by name.&nbsp; There was no
need to bid the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s white horse to pause here; he
stopped of himself at every public-house; nineteen times out of
twenty to the great convenience of his master, for which he got
no thanks; the twentieth time the hunchback did not want to stop,
and he was lavish of abuse of the beast&rsquo;s stupidity in
coming to a standstill.</p>
<p>The white horse drooped his soft white nose and weary neck for
a long, long time under the effigy of his namesake swinging
overhead, and when the Cheap Jack did come out, he seemed so
preoccupied that the tired beast got home with fewer blows than
usual.</p>
<p>He unloaded his cart mechanically, as if in a dream; but when
he touched the pictures, they seemed to awaken a fresh train of
thought.&nbsp; He stamped one of his little feet spitefully on
the ground, and, with a pretty close imitation of George&rsquo;s
dialect, said bitterly, &ldquo;Gearge bean&rsquo;t such a vool as
a looks!&rdquo; adding, after a pause, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do a deal
to pay <i>him</i> off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he turned into the house, he said thoughtfully,
&ldquo;Sal&rsquo;s precious sharp; she allus was.&nbsp; And a
fine woman, too, is Sal!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Not long after the incidents just related, it happened that
business called Mrs. Lake to the neighboring town.&nbsp; She
seldom went out, but a well-to-do aunt was sick, and wished to
see her; and the miller gave his consent to her going.</p>
<p>She met the milk-cart at the corner of the road, and so was
driven to the town, and she took Jan with her.</p>
<p>He had begged hard to go, and was intensely amused by all he
saw.&nbsp; The young Lakes were so thoroughly in the habit of
taking every thing, whether commonplace or curious, in the same
phlegmatic fashion, that Jan&rsquo;s pleasure was a new pleasure
to his foster-mother, and they enjoyed themselves greatly.</p>
<p>As they were making their way towards the inn where they were
to pick up a neighbor, in whose cart they were to be driven home,
their progress was hindered by a crowd, which had collected near
one of the churches.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake was one of those people who lead colorless lives,
and are without mental resources, to whom a calamity is almost
delightful, from the stimulus it gives to the imagination, and
the relief it affords to the monotony of existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&rdquo; she cried, peering through
the crowd: &ldquo;I wonder what it is.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis likely
&rsquo;tis a man in a fit now, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, or a
cart upset, and every soul killed, as it might be ourselves going
home this very evening.&nbsp; Dear, dear! &rsquo;tis a
venturesome thing to leave home, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere they be! &rsquo;ere they be!&rdquo; roared a
wave of the crowd, composed of boys, breaking on Mrs. Lake and
Jan at this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the body, sure as death!&rdquo; murmured the
windmiller&rsquo;s wife; but, as she spoke, the street boys set
up a lusty cheer, and Jan, who had escaped to explore on his own
account, came running back, crying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the Cheap Jack, mammy! and he&rsquo;s been
getting married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If any thing could have rivalled the interest of a sudden
death for Mrs. Lake, it must have been such a wedding as
this.&nbsp; She hurried to the front, and was just in time to
catch sight of the happy couple as they passed down the street,
escorted by a crowd of congratulating boys.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, Cheap John!&rdquo; roared one.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve chose a beauty, you have,&rdquo; cried
another.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s &rsquo;arf a &rsquo;ead taller,
anyway,&rdquo; added a third.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many happy returns of
the day, Jack!&rdquo; yelled a fourth.</p>
<p>Jan was charmed, and again and again he drew Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s
attention to the fact that it really <i>was</i> the Cheap
Jack.</p>
<p>But the windmiller&rsquo;s wife was staring at the
bride.&nbsp; Not merely because the bride is commonly considered
the central figure of a wedding-party, but because her face
seemed familiar to Mrs. Lake, and she could not remember where
she had seen her.&nbsp; Though she could remember nothing, the
association seemed to be one of pain.&nbsp; In vain she beat her
brains.&nbsp; Memory was an almost uncultivated quality with her,
and, like the rest of her intellectual powers, had a nervous,
skittish way of deserting her in need, as if from timidity.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lake could sometimes remember things when she got into
bed, but on this occasion her pillow did not assist her; and the
windmiller snubbed her for making &ldquo;such a caddle&rdquo;
about a woman&rsquo;s face she might have seen anywhere or
nowhere, for that matter; so she got no help from him.</p>
<p>And it was not till after the Cheap Jack and his wife had left
the neighborhood, that one night (she was in bed) it suddenly
&ldquo;came to her,&rdquo; as she said, that the dwarf&rsquo;s
bride was the woman who had brought Jan to the mill, on the night
of the great storm.</p>

ART.&mdash;JAN GOES TO SCHOOL.&mdash;DAME DATCHETT AT
HOME.&mdash;JAN&rsquo;S FIRST SCHOOL SCRAPE.&mdash;JAN DEFENDS
HIMSELF.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> the hero of a tale cannot
always be heroic, nor of romantic or poetic tastes.</p>
<p>The wonderful beauty of the night sky and the moon had been
fully felt by the artist-nature of the child Jan; but about this
time he took to the study of a totally different
subject,&mdash;pigs.</p>
<p>It was the force of circumstances which led Jan to &ldquo;make
pigs&rdquo; on his slate so constantly, instead of nobler
subjects; and it dated from the time when his foster-mother began
to send him with the other children to school at Dame
Datchett&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Dame Datchett&rsquo;s cottage was the last house on one side
of the village main street.&nbsp; It was low, thatched,
creeper-covered, and had only one floor, and two rooms,&mdash;the
outer room where the Dame kept her school, and the inner one
where she slept.&nbsp; Dame Datchett&rsquo;s scholars were very
young, and it is to be hoped that the chief objects of their
parents in paying for their schooling were to insure their being
kept safely out of the way for a certain portion of each day, and
the saving of wear and tear to clothes and shoes.&nbsp; It is to
be hoped so, because this much of discipline was to some extent
accomplished.&nbsp; As to learning, Dame Datchett had little
enough herself, and was quite unable to impart even that, except
to a very industrious and intelligent pupil.</p>
<p>Her school appurtenances were few and simple.&nbsp; From one
of them arose Jan&rsquo;s first scrape at school.&nbsp; It was a
long, narrow blackboard, on which the alphabet had once been
painted white, though the letters were now so faded that the Dame
could no longer distinguish them, even in spectacles.</p>
<p>The scrape came about thus.</p>
<p>As he stood at the bottom of the little class which gathered
in a semicircle around the Dame&rsquo;s chair, his young eyes
could see the faded letters quite clearly, though the
Dame&rsquo;s could not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say th&rsquo; alphabet, childern!&rdquo; cried Dame
Datchett; and as the class shouted the names of the letters after
her, she made a show of pointing to each with a long
&ldquo;sallywithy&rdquo; wand cut from one of the willows in the
water-meadows below.&nbsp; She ran the sallywithy along the board
at what she esteemed a judicious rate, to keep pace with the
shouted alphabet, but, as she could not see the letters, her
tongue and her wand were not in accord.&nbsp; Little did the
wide-mouthed, white-headed youngsters of the village heed this,
but it troubled Jan&rsquo;s eyes; and when&mdash;in consequence
of her rubbing her nose with her disengaged hand&mdash;the
sallywithy slipped to Q as the Dame cried F, Jan brought the lore
he had gained from Abel to bear upon her inaccuracy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a Q, not a F,&rdquo; he said, boldly and
aloud.</p>
<p>A titter ran through the class, and the biggest and stupidest
boy found the joke so overwhelming that he stretched his mouth
from ear to ear, and doubled himself up with laughter, till it
looked as if his corduroy-breeched knee were a turnip, and he
about to munch it.</p>
<p>The Dame dropped her sallywithy and began to feel under her
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which be the young varment as said a F was a Q?&rdquo;
she rather unfairly inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A didn&rsquo;t say a F was a Q&rdquo;&mdash; began Jan;
but a chorus of cowardly little voices drowned him, and curried
favor with the Dame by crying, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Jan Lake, the
miller&rsquo;s son, missus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the big boy, conscious of his own breach of good manners,
atoned for it by officiously dragging Jan to Dame
Datchett&rsquo;s elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold un vor me,&rdquo; said the Dame, settling her
spectacles firmly on her nose.</p>
<p>And with infinite delight the great booby held Jan to receive
his thwacks from the strap which the Dame had of late years
substituted for the birch rod.&nbsp; And as Jan writhed, he
chuckled as heartily as before, it being an amiable feature in
the character of such clowns that, so long as they can enjoy a
guffaw at somebody&rsquo;s expense, the subject of their ridicule
is not a matter of much choice or discrimination.</p>
<p>After the first angry sob, Jan set his teeth and bore his
punishment in a proud silence, quite incomprehensible by the
small rustics about him, who, like the pigs of the district, were
in the habit of crying out in good time before they were hurt as
a preventive measure.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, it gave the biggest boy the impression that
Jan was &ldquo;poor-spirited,&rdquo; and unable to take his own
part,&mdash;a temptation to bully him too strong to be
resisted.</p>
<p>So when the school broke up, and the children were scattering
over the road and water-meads, the wide-mouthed boy came up to
Jan and snatched his slate from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give Jan his slate!&rdquo; cried Jan, indignantly.</p>
<p>He was five years old, but the other was seven, and he held
the slate above his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who be <i>Jan</i>, then, thee little
gallus-bird?&rdquo; said he, tauntingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be Jan!&rdquo; answered the little fellow,
defiantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jan Lake, the miller&rsquo;s son.&nbsp;
Give I his slate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s not a miller&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; said the
other; and the rest of the children began to gather round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be a miller&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; reiterated Jan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got a miller&rsquo;s thumb, too;&rdquo; and
he turned up his little thumb for confirmation of the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s not a miller&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; repeated
the other, with a grin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s
child, thee is.&nbsp; Master Lake&rsquo;s not thy vather, nor
Mrs. Lake bean&rsquo;t thy mother.&nbsp; Thee was brought to the
mill in a sack of grist, thee was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In saying which, the boy repeated a popular version of
Jan&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>If any one had been present outside Dame Datchett&rsquo;s
cottage at that moment who had been in the windmill when Jan
first came to it, he would have seen a likeness so vivid between
the face of the child and the face of the man who brought him to
the mill as would have seemed to clear up at least one point of
the mystery of his parentage.</p>
<p>Pride and wrath convulsed every line of the square, quaint
face, and seemed to narrow it to the likeness of the man&rsquo;s,
as, with his black eyes blazing with passion, Jan flew at his
enemy.</p>
<p>The boy still held Jan&rsquo;s slate on high, and with a
derisive &ldquo;haw! haw!&rdquo; he brought it down heavily above
Jan&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; But Jan&rsquo;s eye was quick, and very
true.&nbsp; He dodged the blow, which fell on the boy&rsquo;s own
knees, and then flew at him like a kitten in a tiger fury.</p>
<p>They were both small and easily knocked over, and in an
instant they were sprawling on the road, and cuffing, and
pulling, and kicking, and punching with about equal success,
except that the bigger boy prudently roared and howled all the
time, in the hope of securing some assistance in his favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dame Datchett!&nbsp; Missus!&nbsp; Murder!&nbsp;
Yah!&nbsp; Boohoo!&nbsp; The little varment be a throttling
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Datchett was deaf.&nbsp; Also, she not unnaturally
considered that, in looking after &ldquo;the young
varments&rdquo; in school-hours, she fully earned their weekly
pence, and was by no means bound to disturb herself because they
squabbled in the street.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jan gradually got the upper hand of his lubberly and
far from courageous opponent, whose smock he had nearly torn off
his back.&nbsp; He had not spent any of his breath in calling for
aid, but now, in reply to the boy&rsquo;s cries for mercy and
release, he shouted, &ldquo;What be my name, now, thee big
gawney?&nbsp; Speak, or I&rsquo;ll drottle &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan Lake,&rdquo; said his vanquished foe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let me go!&nbsp; Yah! yah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose son be I?&rdquo; asked the remorseless Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abel Lake&rsquo;s, the miller!&nbsp; Boohoo,
boohoo!&rdquo; sobbed the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what be this, then, Willum Smith?&rdquo; was
Jan&rsquo;s final question, as he brought his thumb close to his
enemy&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be the miller&rsquo;s thumb thee&rsquo;s got, Jan
Lake,&rdquo; was the satisfactory answer.</p>

ADVICE.&mdash;THE CLOCK FACE.&mdash;THE HORNET AND THE
DAME.&mdash;JAN DRAWS PIGS.&mdash;JAN AND HIS
PATRONS.&mdash;KITTY CHUTER.&mdash;THE FIGHT.&mdash;MASTER
CHUTER&rsquo;S PREDICTION.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jan</span> went back to school.&nbsp;
Though his foster-mother was indignant, and ready to do battle
both with Dame Datchett and with William Smith&rsquo;s aunt (with
whom, in lieu of parents, the boy lived), and though Abel
expressed his anxiety to go down and &ldquo;teach Willum to vight
one of his own zize,&rdquo; Jan steadily rejected their help, and
said manfully, &ldquo;Jan bean&rsquo;t feared of un.&nbsp; I
whopped un, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mrs. Lake doctored his bruises, and sent him off to school
again.&nbsp; She yielded the more readily that she felt certain
that the windmiller would not take the child&rsquo;s part against
the Dame.</p>
<p>No further misfortune befell him.&nbsp; William, if loutish
and a bit of a bully on occasion, was not an ill-natured child;
and, having a turn for humor of a broad, unintellectual sort, he
and Jan became rather friendly on the common, but reprehensible
ground of playing pranks, which kept the school in a titter and
the Dame in doubt.&nbsp; And, if detected, they did not think a
dose of the strap by any means too high a price to pay for their
fun.</p>
<p>For William&rsquo;s sufferings under that instrument of
discipline were not to be measured by his doleful howlings and
roarings, nor even by his ready tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be &rsquo;ee so voolish for as to say
nothin&rsquo; when her wollops &rsquo;ee?&rdquo; he asked of Jan,
in a very friendly spirit, one day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thee should
holler as loud as &rsquo;ee can.&nbsp; Them that hollers and
cries murder she soon stops for, does Dame Datchett.&nbsp; She be
feared of their mothers hearing &rsquo;em, and comin&rsquo; after
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan could not lower himself to accept such base advice; but
his superior adroitness did much to balance the advantage William
had over him, in a less scrupulous pride.</p>
<p>As to learning, I fear that, after the untoward consequences
of his zeal for the alphabet, Jan made no effort to learn any
thing but cat&rsquo;s-cradle from his neighbors.</p>
<p>On one other occasion, indeed, he was somewhat over-zealous,
and only escaped the strap for his reward by a friendly diversion
on the part of his friend.&nbsp; The Dame had a Dutch clock in
the corner of her kitchen, the figures on the face of which were
the common Arabic ones, and not Roman.&nbsp; And as one of the
few things the Dame professed was to &ldquo;teach the
clock,&rdquo; she would, when the figures had been recited after
the fashion in which her scholars shouted over the alphabet, set
those who had advanced to the use of slates to copy the figures
from the clock-face.</p>
<p>Slowly and sorrowfully did William toil over this
lesson.&nbsp; Again and again did he rub out his ill-proportioned
fives, with so greasy a finger and such a superabundance of
moisture as to make a sort of puddle, into which he dug heavily,
and broke two pencils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A vive be such an akkerd vigger,&rdquo; he muttered, in
reply to Jan, who had looked up inquiringly as the second pencil
snapped.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twill come aal right, though, when a
dries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did dry, but any thing but right.&nbsp; Jan rubbed out the
mass of thick and blotted strokes, and when the Dame was not
looking, he made William&rsquo;s figures for him.&nbsp; Jan was
behindhand in spelling, but to copy figures was no difficulty to
him.</p>
<p>Having helped his friend thus, he pulled his smock, to draw
attention to his own slate.&nbsp; The other children wrote so
slowly that time had hung heavy on his hands; and, instead of
copying the figures in a row, he had made a drawing of the
clock-face, with the figures on it; but instead of the hands, he
had put eyes, nose, and mouth, and below the mouth a round gray
blot, which William instantly recognized for a portrait of the
mole on Dame Datchett&rsquo;s chin.&nbsp; This brilliant
caricature so tickled him, that he had a fit of choking from
suppressed laughter; and he and Jan, being detected &ldquo;in
mischief,&rdquo; were summoned with their slates to the
Dame&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>William came off triumphant; but when the Dame caught sight of
Jan&rsquo;s slate, without minutely examining his work, she said,
&ldquo;Zo thee&rsquo;s been scraaling on thee slate, instead of
writing thee figures,&rdquo; and at once began to fumble beneath
her chair.</p>

 src="images/p106s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But William had slightly moved the strap with his foot, as he
stood with a perfectly unmoved and vacant countenance beside the
Dame, which made some delay; and as Mrs. Datchett bent lower on
the right side of her chair, William began upon the left a
&ldquo;hum,&rdquo; which, with a close imitation of the crowing
of a cock, the grunting of a pig, and the braying of a donkey,
formed his chief stock of accomplishments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drat the thing!&nbsp; Where be un?&rdquo; said the
Dame, endangering her balance in the search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;B-z-z-z-z!&rdquo; went William behind the chair; and he
added, <i>sotto voce</i>, to Jan, &ldquo;She be as dunch as a
bittle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the Dame heard, and looked round.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be that
a harnet, missus, do &rsquo;ee think?&rdquo; said William, with a
face as guileless as a babe&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Dame Datchett rose in terror.&nbsp; William bent to look
beneath her chair for the hornet, and of course repeated his
hum.&nbsp; As the hornet could neither be found nor got rid of,
the alarmed old lady broke up the school, and went to lay a trap
of brown sugar outside the window for her enemy.&nbsp; And so Jan
escaped a beating.</p>
<p>But this and the story of his first fight are
digressions.&nbsp; It yet remains to be told how he took to
drawing pigs.</p>
<p>Dame Datchett&rsquo;s cottage was the last on one side of the
street; but it did not face the street, but looked over the
water-meadows, and the little river, and the bridge.</p>
<p>As Jan sat on the end of the form, he could look through the
Dame&rsquo;s open door, the chief view from which was of a place
close by the bridge, and on the river&rsquo;s bank, where the
pig-minders of the village brought their pigs to water.&nbsp; Day
after day, when the tedium of doing nothing under Dame
Datchett&rsquo;s superintendence was insufficiently relieved to
Jan&rsquo;s active mind by pinching &ldquo;Willum&rdquo; till he
giggled, or playing cat&rsquo;s-cradle with one of his
foster-brothers, did he welcome the sight of a flock of pigs with
their keeper, scuttling past the Dame&rsquo;s door, and rushing
snorting to the stream.</p>
<p>Much he envied the freedom of the happy pig-minder, whilst the
vagaries of the pigs were an unfailing source of amusement.</p>
<p>The degree and variety of expression in a pig&rsquo;s eye can
only be appreciated by those who have studied pigs as Morland
must have studied them.&nbsp; The pertness, the liveliness, the
humor, the love of mischief, the fiendish ingenuity and
perversity of which pigs are capable, can be fully known to the
careworn pig-minder alone.&nbsp; When they are running
away,&mdash;and when are they not running away?&mdash;they have
an action with the hind legs very like a donkey in a state of
revolt.&nbsp; But they have none of the donkey&rsquo;s too
numerous grievances.&nbsp; And if donkeys squealed at every
switch, as pigs do, their undeserved sufferings would have cried
loud enough for vengeance before this.</p>
<p>Jan&rsquo;s opportunities for studying pigs were good.&nbsp;
As the smallest and swiftest of the flock, his tail tightly
curled, and indescribable jauntiness in his whole demeanor, came
bounding to the river&rsquo;s brink, followed by his fellows,
driving, pushing, snuffing, winking, and gobbling, and lastly by
a small boy in a large coat, with a long switch, Jan was witness
of the whole scene from Dame Datchett&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; And, as
he sat with his slate and pencil before him, he naturally took to
drawing the quaint comic faces and expressive eyes of the herd,
and their hardly less expressive backs and tails; and to
depicting the scenes which took place when the pigs had enjoyed
their refreshment, and with renewed vigor led their keeper in
twenty different directions, instead of going home.&nbsp; Back,
up the road, where he could hardly drive them at the point of the
switch a few hours before; by sharp turns into Squire
Ammaby&rsquo;s grounds, or the churchyard; and helter-skelter
through the water-meadows.</p>
<p>The fame of Jan&rsquo;s &ldquo;pitcher-making&rdquo; had gone
before him to Dame Datchett&rsquo;s school by the mouths of his
foster-brothers and sisters, and he found a dozen little voices
ready to dictate subjects for his pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a &rsquo;ouse, Janny Lake.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Make thee vather&rsquo;s mill, Janny Lake.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Make a man.&nbsp; Make Dame Datchett.&nbsp; Make the
parson.&nbsp; Make the Cheap Jack.&nbsp; Make Daddy Angel.&nbsp;
Make Master Chuter.&nbsp; Make a
oss&mdash;cow&mdash;ship&mdash;pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the popularity obtained by Jan&rsquo;s pigs soon surpassed
that of all his other performances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make pigs for I, Janny Lake!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Make
pigs for I, too!&rdquo; was a sort of whispering chorus that went
on perpetually under the Dame&rsquo;s nose.&nbsp; But when she
found that it led to no disturbance, that the children only
huddled round the child Jan and his slate like eager scholars
round a teacher, Dame Datchett was wise enough to be thankful
that Jan possessed a power she had never been able to
acquire,&mdash;that he could &ldquo;keep the young varments
quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be most&rsquo;s good&rsquo;s a monitor,&rdquo;
thought the Dame; and she took a nap, and Jan&rsquo;s genius held
the school together.</p>
<p>The children tried other influences besides persuasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan Lake, I&rsquo;ve brought thee an apple.&nbsp; Draa
out a pig for I on a&rsquo;s slate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan had a spirit of the most upright and honorable kind.&nbsp;
He never took an unfair advantage, and to the petty cunning which
was &ldquo;Willum&rsquo;s&rdquo; only idea of wisdom he seemed by
nature incapable of stooping.&nbsp; But in addition to, and
alongside of, his artistic temperament, there appeared to be in
him no small share of the spirit of a trader.&nbsp; The
capricious, artistic spirit made him fitful in his use even of
the beloved slate; but, when he was least inclined to draw, the
offer of something he very much wanted would spur him to work;
and in the spirit of a true trader, he worked well.</p>
<p>He would himself have made a charming study for a painter, as
he sat surrounded by his patrons, who watched him with gaping
mouths of wonderment, as his black eyes moved rapidly to and fro
between the river&rsquo;s brink and his slate, and his tiny
fingers steered the pencil into cunning lines which &ldquo;made
pigs.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The very moral!&rdquo; as William
declared, smacking his corduroy breeches with delight.</p>
<p>Sometimes Jan hardly knew that they were there, he was so
absorbed in his work.&nbsp; His eyes glowed with that strong
pleasure which comes in the very learning of any art, perhaps of
any craft.&nbsp; Now and then, indeed, his face would cloud with
a different expression, and in fits of annoyance, like that in
which his foster-mother found him outside the windmill, he would
break his pencils, and ruthlessly destroy sketches with which his
patrons would have been quite satisfied.&nbsp; But at other
moments his face would twinkle with a very sunshine of smiles, as
he was conscious of having caught exactly the curve which
expressed obstinacy in this pig&rsquo;s back, or the air of
reckless defiance in that other&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>And so he learned little or nothing, and improved in his
drawing, and kept the school quiet, and had always a pocket well
filled with sweet things, nails, string, tops, balls, and such
treasures, earned by his art.</p>
<p>One day as he sat &ldquo;making pigs&rdquo; for one after
another of the group of children round him, a pig of especial
humor having drawn a murmur of delight from the circle, this
murmur was dismally echoed by a sob from a little maid on the
outside of the group.&nbsp; It was Master Chuter&rsquo;s little
daughter, a pretty child, with an oval, dainty-featured face, and
a prim gentleness about her, like a good little girl in a good
little story.&nbsp; The intervening young rustics began to nudge
each other and look back at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty Chuter be crying!&rdquo; they whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be amiss with &rsquo;ee, then, Kitty
Chuter?&rdquo; said Jan, looking up from his work; and the
question was passed on with some impatience, as her tears
prevented her reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;What be amiss with
&rsquo;ee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janny Lake have never made a pig for I,&rdquo; sobbed
the little maid, with her head dolefully inclined to her left
shoulder, and her oval face pulled to a doubly pensive
length.&nbsp; &ldquo;I axed my vather to let me get him a posy,
and a said I might.&nbsp; And I got un some vine Bloody Warriors,
and a heap of Boy&rsquo;s Love off our big bush, that smelled
beautiful.&nbsp; And vather says a can have some water-blobs off
our pond when they blows.&nbsp; But Tommy Green met I as a was
coming down to school, and a snatched my vlowers from me, and I
begged un to let me keep some of un, and a only laughed at
me.&nbsp; And I daren&rsquo;t go back, for I was late; and now
I&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; to give Janny Lake to make a draft of a
pig for I.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, having held up for the telling of
her tale, the little maid broke down in fresh tears.</p>
<p>Jan finished off the tail of the pig he was drawing with a
squeak of the pencil that might have come from the pig itself
and, stuffing the slate into its owner&rsquo;s hands, he ran up
to Kitty Chuter and kissed her wet cheeks, saying, &ldquo;Give I
thee slate, Kitty Chuter, and I&rsquo;ll make thee the best pig
of all.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want nothing from thee for
&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And when school&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;ll whop
Tommy Green, if I sees him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And forthwith, without looking from the door for studies, Jan
drew a fat sow with her little ones about her; the other children
clustering round to peep, and crying, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ve made
Kitty Chuter one, two, three, vour, <i>vive</i> pigs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, and there be two more you can&rsquo;t see, because
the old un be lying on &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six, seven!&rdquo; William counted; and he assisted the
calculation by sticking up first a thumb and then a forefinger as
he spoke.</p>
<p>Some who had not thought half a ball of string, or a dozen
nails as good as new, too much to pay for a single pig drawn on
one side of their slates, and only lasting as long as they could
contrive to keep the other side in use without quite smudging
that one, were now disposed to be dissatisfied with their
bargains.&nbsp; But as the school broke up, and Tom Green was
seen loitering on the other side of the road, every thing was
forgotten in the general desire to see Jan carry out his threat,
and &ldquo;whop&rdquo; a boy bigger than himself for bullying a
little girl.</p>
<p>Jan showed no disposition to shirk, and William acted as his
friend, and held his slate and book.</p>
<p>Success is not always to the just, however; and poor Jan was
terribly beaten by his big opponent, though not without giving
him some marks of the combat to carry away.</p>
<p>Kitty Chuter wept bitterly for Jan&rsquo;s bloody nose; but he
comforted her, saying, &ldquo;Never mind, Kitty; if he plagues
thee again, &rsquo;ll fight un again and again, till I whops
he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his valor was not put to the proof, for Tommy Green
molested her no more.</p>
<p>Jan washed his face in the water-meadows, and went
stout-heartedly home, where Master Lake beat him afresh, as he
ironically said, &ldquo;to teach him to vight young varments like
himself instead of minding his book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But upon Master Chuter, of the Heart of Oak, the incident made
quite a different impression.&nbsp; He was naturally pleased by
Jan&rsquo;s championship of his child, and, added to this, he was
much impressed by the sketch on the slate.&nbsp; It was, he said,
the &ldquo;living likeness&rdquo; of his own sow; and, as she had
seven young pigs, the portrait was exact, allowing for the two
which Jan had said were out of sight.</p>
<p>He gave Kitty a new slate, and kept the sketch, which he
showed to all in-comers.&nbsp; He displayed it one evening to the
company assembled round the hearth of the little inn, and took
occasion to propound his views on the subject of Jan&rsquo;s
future life.</p>
<p>(Master Chuter was fond of propounding his views,&mdash;a
taste which was developed by always being sure of an
audience.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to me,&rdquo; said Master Chuter,
speaking of Jan, &ldquo;who the boy be.&nbsp; It be no fault of
his&rsquo;n if he&rsquo;s a fondling.&nbsp; And one thing&rsquo;s
sure enough.&nbsp; Them that left him with Master Lake left
something besides him.&nbsp; There was that
advertisement,&mdash;you remember that about the five-pound bill
in the paper, Daddy Angel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Master Chuter,&rdquo; said Daddy Angel;
&ldquo;after the big storm, five year ago.&nbsp; Sartinly, Master
Chuter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it ever found, do ye think?&rdquo; said Master
Linseed, the painter and decorator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been found,&rdquo; said the landlord;
&ldquo;but I bean&rsquo;t so sure about it&rsquo;s having been
given up, the notice was in so long.&nbsp; And whoever did find
un must have found un at once.&nbsp; But what I says is,
five-pound notes lost as easy as that comes from where
there&rsquo;s more of the same sort.&nbsp; And, if Master Lake be
paid for the boy, he can &rsquo;fford to &rsquo;prentice him when
his time comes.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ve boys enough of his own to take
to the mill, and Jan do seem to have such an uncommon turn for
drawing things out, I&rsquo;d try him with painting and
varnishing, if he was mine.&nbsp; And I believe he&rsquo;d come
to signs, too!&nbsp; Look at that, now!&nbsp; It be small, and
the boy&rsquo;ve had no paint to lay on, but there&rsquo;s the
sign of the Jolly Sow for you, as natteral as life.&nbsp; You
know about signs, Master Linseed,&rdquo; continued the
landlord.&nbsp; For there was a tradition that the painter could
&ldquo;do picture-signs,&rdquo; though he had only been known to
renew lettered ones since he came to the neighborhood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Master Lake should &rsquo;prentice him with you when
he&rsquo;s older,&rdquo; Master Chuter said in conclusion.</p>
<p>But Master Linseed did not respond warmly.&nbsp; He felt it a
little beneath his dignity as a sign-painter to jump at the idea,
though the rest of the company assented in a general murmur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scrawling on a slate,&rdquo; the painter and decorator
began&mdash;and at this point he paused, after the leisurely
customs of the district, to light his pipe at the leaden-weighted
candlestick which stood near; and then, as his hearers sat
expectant, but not impatient, proceeded: &ldquo;Scrawling on a
slate is one thing, Master Chuter: painting and
decorating&rsquo;s another.&nbsp; Painting&rsquo;s a trade; and
not rightly to be understood by them that&rsquo;s not larned it,
nor to be picked up by all as can scrawl a line here and a line
there, as the whim takes &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Take
oak-graining,&rdquo;&mdash;and here Master Linseed paused again,
with a fine sense of effect,&mdash;&ldquo;who&rsquo;d ever think
of taking a comb to it as didn&rsquo;t know?&nbsp; And for the
knots, I&rsquo;ve worked &rsquo;em&mdash;now with a finger and
now a thumb&mdash;over a shutter-front till it looked that
beautiful the man it was done for telled me
himself,&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;have &rsquo;em as you&rsquo;ve done &rsquo;em than the
real thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; But young hands is nowhere with the
knots.&nbsp; They puts &rsquo;em in too thick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company said, &ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; in a tone of unbroken
assent, for Master Linseed was understood to have &ldquo;come
from a distance,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;know a good
deal.&rdquo;&nbsp; But an innkeeper stands above a painter and
decorator anywhere, and especially on his own hearth, and Master
Chuter did not mean to be put down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose old hands were young uns once, Master
Linseed,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and if the boy were never much at
oak-graining, I&rsquo;d back him for sign-painting, if he were
taught.&nbsp; Why, the pigs he draas out, look you.&nbsp; I could
cut &rsquo;em up, and not a piece missing; not a joint, nor as
much as would make a pound of sausages.&nbsp; And if a draas
pigs, why not osses, why not any other kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; said the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be thinking,&rdquo; continued Master Chuter,
&ldquo;of a gentlemen as draad out that mare of my father&rsquo;s
that ran in the mail.&nbsp; You remember the coaches, Daddy
Angel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Master Chuter.&nbsp; Between Lonnon and Exeter
a ran.&nbsp; Fine days at the Heart of Oak, then, Master
Chuter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He weren&rsquo;t a sign-painter, that I knows on.&nbsp;
A were somethin&rsquo; more in the gentry way,&rdquo; said Master
Chuter, not, perhaps, quite without malice in the
distinction.&nbsp; &ldquo;He were what they calls in genteel talk
a&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Artis&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Master Linseed, removing his
pipe, to supply the missing word with a sense of superiority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a artis&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Master Chuter,
&ldquo;though it do begin with a A, too.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t a artis&rsquo; he was, &rsquo;twas
a&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ammytoor,&rdquo; said the travelled sign-painter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be it,&rdquo; said the innkeeper.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
ammytoor.&nbsp; And he was short of money, I fancy, and so
&rsquo;twas settled a should paint this mare of my father&rsquo;s
to set against the bill.&nbsp; And a draad and a squinted at un,
and a squinted at un and a draad, and laid the paint on till the
pictur&rsquo; looked all in a mess, and then he took un away to
vinish.&nbsp; But when a sent it home, I thought my vather would
have had the law of un.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blessed if a hadn&rsquo;t
given the mare four white feet, and shoulders that wouldn&rsquo;t
have pulled a vegetable cart; and she near-wheeler of the
mail!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d lay a pound bill Jan Lake would a done her
ever so much better, for as young a hand as a is, if a&rsquo;d
squinted at her as long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Master Chuter,&rdquo; said the painter and
decorator, rising to go, &ldquo;let the boy draw pigs and osses
for his living.&nbsp; And I wish he may find paint as easy as
slate-pencil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Linseed&rsquo;s parting words produced upon the company
that somewhat unreasonable depression which such ironical good
wishes are apt to cause; but they only roused the spirit of
contradiction in Master Chuter, and heightened his belief in
Jan&rsquo;s talents more than any praise from the painter could
have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pretty caddle about giving a boy&rsquo;s
due!&rdquo; said the innkeeper.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I knows the
points of a oss, and the makings of a pig, if I bean&rsquo;t a
sign-painter.&nbsp; And, mark my words, the boy Jan &rsquo;ull
out-paint Master Linseed yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Chuter spoke with triumph in his tone, but it was the
triumph of delivering his sentiments to unopposing hearers.</p>
<p>There were moments of greater triumph to come, of which he yet
wotted not, when the sevenfold fulfilment of his prediction
should be past dispute, and attested from his own walls by more
lasting monuments of Jan&rsquo;s skill than the too perishable
sketch which now stood like a text for the innkeeper on the
mantelpiece of the Heart of Oak.</p>

118</span>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE MOP.&mdash;THE
SHOP.&mdash;WHAT THE CHEAP JACK&rsquo;S WIFE HAD TO
TELL.&mdash;WHAT GEORGE WITHHELD.</span></p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">mop</span> is a local name for a
hiring-fair, at which young men and women present themselves to
be hired as domestic servants or farm laborers for a year.&nbsp;
It was at a mop that the windmiller had hired George, and it was
at that annual festival that his long service came to an
end.&nbsp; He betook himself to the town, where the fair was
going on, not with any definite intention of seeking another
master, but from a variety of reasons: partly for a holiday, and
to &ldquo;see the fun;&rdquo; partly to visit the Cheap Jack, and
hear what advice he had to give, and to learn what was in the
letter; partly with the idea that something might suggest itself
in the busy town as a suitable investment for his savings and his
talents.&nbsp; At the worst, he could but take another place.</p>
<p>The sun shone brightly on the market-place as George passed
through it.&nbsp; The scene was quaint and picturesque.&nbsp;
Booths, travelling shows, penny theatres, quack doctors,
tumblers, profile cutters, exhibitors and salesmen of all sorts,
thronged the square, and overflowed into a space behind, where
some houses had been burnt down and never rebuilt; whilst round
the remains of the market cross in the centre were grouped the
lads and lasses &ldquo;on hire.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girls were
smartly dressed, and the young men in snowy smocks, above which
peeped waistcoats of gay colors, looked in the earlier part of
the day so spruce, that it was as lamentable to see them after
the hours of beer-drinking and shag tobacco-smoking which
followed, as it was to see what might have been a neighborly and
cheerful festival finally swamped in drunkenness and
debauchery.</p>
<p>George&rsquo;s smock was white, and George&rsquo;s waistcoat
was red, and he had made himself smart enough, but he did not
linger amongst his fellow-servants at the Cross.&nbsp; He hurried
through the crowd, nodding sheepishly in answer to a shower of
chaff and greetings, and made his way to the by-street where the
Cheap Jack had a small dingy shop for the sale of coarse
pottery.&nbsp; Some people were spiteful enough to hint that the
shop-trade was of much less value to him than the store-room
attached, where the goods were believed to be not all of one
kind.</p>
<p>The red bread-pans, pipkins, flower-pots, and so forth, were
grouped about the door with some attempt at effective display,
and with cheap prices marked in chalk upon their sides.&nbsp; The
window was clean, and in it many knick-knacks of other kinds were
mixed with the smaller china ware.&nbsp; And, when George entered
the shop, the hunchback&rsquo;s wife was behind the
counter.&nbsp; Like Mrs. Lake, he paused to think where he could
have seen her before; the not uncomely face marred by an ugly
mouth, in which the upper lip was long and cleft, and the lower
lip large and heavy, seemed familiar to him.&nbsp; He was still
beating his brains when the Cheap Jack came in.</p>
<p>George had been puzzled that the woman&rsquo;s countenance did
not seem new to him, and he was puzzled and disturbed also that
the expression on the face of the Cheap Jack was quite new.&nbsp;
Whatever the hunchback had in his head, however, he was not
unfriendly in his manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, George, my dear!&rdquo; he cried,
cheerfully; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve seen my missus before, eh,
George?&rdquo;&nbsp; George was just about to say no, when he
remembered that he had seen the woman, and when and where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadful night that was, Mr. Sannel!&rdquo; said the
Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife, with a smile on her large mouth.&nbsp;
George assented, and by the hospitable invitation of the newly
married couple he followed them into the dwelling part of the
house, trying as he did so to decide upon a plan for his future
conduct.</p>
<p>Here at last was a woman who could probably tell all that he
wanted to know about the mystery on which he had hoped to trade,
and&mdash;the Cheap Jack had married her.&nbsp; If any thing
could be got out of the knowledge of Jan&rsquo;s history, the
Cheap Jack, and not George, would get it now.&nbsp; The hasty
resolution to which George came was to try to share what he could
not keep entirely to himself.&nbsp; He flattered himself he could
be very civil, and&mdash;he had got the letter.</p>
<p>It proved useful.&nbsp; George was resolved not to show it
until he had got at something of what the large-mouthed woman had
to tell; and, as she wanted to see the letter, she made a virtue
of necessity, and seemed anxious to help the miller&rsquo;s man
to the utmost of her power.</p>
<p>The history of her connection with Jan&rsquo;s babyhood was
soon told, and she told it truthfully.</p>
<p>Five years before her marriage to the Cheap Jack, she was a
chambermaid in a small hotel in London, and &ldquo;under notice
to leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why&mdash;she did not deem it necessary to
tell George.&nbsp; In this hotel Jan was born, and Jan&rsquo;s
mother died.&nbsp; She was a foreigner, it was supposed, and her
husband also, for they talked a foreign language to each
other.&nbsp; He was not with her when she first came, but he
joined her afterwards, and was with her at her death.&nbsp; So
far the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife spoke upon hearsay.&nbsp; Though
employed at the hotel, which was very full, she was not sleeping
in the house; she was not on good terms with the landlady, nor
even with the other servants, and her first real connection with
the matter was when the gentleman, overhearing some
&ldquo;words&rdquo; between her and the landlady at the bar,
abruptly asked her if she were in want of employment.&nbsp; He
employed her,&mdash;to take the child to the very town where she
was now living as the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; He did not
come with her, as he had to attend his wife&rsquo;s
funeral.&nbsp; It was understood at the hotel that he was going
to take the body abroad for interment.&nbsp; So the porter had
said.&nbsp; The person to whom she was directed to bring the
child was a respectable old woman, living in the outskirts of the
town, whose business was sick-nursing.&nbsp; She seemed, however,
to be comfortably off, and had not been out for some time.&nbsp;
She had been nurse to the gentleman in his childhood, so she once
told the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife with tears.&nbsp; But she was
always shedding tears, either over the baby, or as she sat over
her big Bible, &ldquo;for ever having to wipe her spectacles, and
tears running over her nose ridic&rsquo;lus to
behold.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was pious, and read the Bible aloud in
the evening.&nbsp; Then she had fainting fits; she could not go
uphill or upstairs without great difficulty, and she had one of
her fits when she first saw the child.&nbsp; If with these
infirmities of body and mind the ex-nurse had been easily
managed, the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife professed that she could
have borne it with patience.&nbsp; But the old woman was
painfully shrewd, and there was no hoodwinking her.&nbsp; She
never allowed the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife to go out without her,
and contrived, in spite of a hundred plans and excuses, to
prevent her from speaking to any of the townspeople alone.&nbsp;
Never, said Sal, never could she have put up with it, even for
the short time before the gentleman came down to them, but for
knowing it would be a paying job.&nbsp; But his arrival was the
signal for another catastrophe, which ended in Jan&rsquo;s
becoming a child of the mill.</p>
<p>If the sight of the baby had nearly overpowered the old nurse,
the sight of the dark-eyed gentleman overwhelmed her yet
more.&nbsp; Then they were closeted together for a long time, and
the old woman&rsquo;s tongue hardly ever stopped.&nbsp; Sal
explained that she would not have been such a fool as to let this
conversation escape her, if she could have helped it.&nbsp; She
took her place at the keyhole, and had an excuse ready for the
old woman, if she should come out suddenly.&nbsp; The old woman
came out suddenly; but she did not wait for the excuse.&nbsp; She
sent the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife civilly on an errand into the
kitchen, and then followed her, and shut the door and turned the
key upon her without hesitation, leaving her unable to hear any
thing but the tones of the conversation through the parlor
wall.&nbsp; She never opened the door again.&nbsp; As far as the
Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife could tell, the old woman seemed to be
remonstrating and pleading; the gentleman spoke now and
then.&nbsp; Then there was a lull, then a thud, then a short
pause, and then the parlor-door was burst open, and the gentleman
came flying towards the kitchen, and calling for the Cheap
Jack&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; The fact that the door was locked caused
some delay, and delay was not desirable.&nbsp; The old nurse had
had &ldquo;a fit.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the doctor came, he gave no
hope of her life.&nbsp; She had had heart disease for many years,
he said.&nbsp; In the midst of this confusion, a letter came for
the gentleman, which seemed absolutely to distract him.&nbsp; He
bade Sal get the little Jan ready, and put his clothes together,
and they started that evening for the mill.&nbsp; Sal believed it
was the doctor who recommended Mrs. Lake as a foster-mother for
the baby, having attended her child.&nbsp; The storm came on
after they started.&nbsp; The child had been very sickly ever
since they left London.&nbsp; The gentleman took the Cheap
Jack&rsquo;s wife straight back to the station, paid her
handsomely, and sent her up to town again.&nbsp; She had never
seen him since.&nbsp; As to his name, it so happened she had
never heard it at the hotel; but when he was setting her off to
the country with the child, she asked it, and he told her that it
was Ford.&nbsp; The old nurse also spoke of him as Mr. Ford,
but&mdash;so Sal fancied&mdash;with a sort of effort, which made
her suspect that it was not his real name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it be!&rdquo; said George, who had followed the
narrative with open-mouthed interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;It be aal
right.&nbsp; I knows.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a gentleman by the name
of Ford as cried his pocket-book, and the vive-pound bill in the
papers.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis aal right.&nbsp; Ford&mdash;Jan Ford be
the little varment&rsquo;s name then, and he be gentry-born,
too!&nbsp; Missus Lake she allus said so, she did,
sartinly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George was so absorbed by the flood of information which had
burst upon him all at once, and by adjusting his clumsy thoughts
to the new view of Jan, that he did not stop to think whether the
Cheap Jack and his wife had known of the lost pocket-book and the
reward.&nbsp; They had not.&nbsp; The dark gentleman had no wish
to reopen communication with the woman he had employed.&nbsp; He
thought (and rightly) that the book had fallen when he stumbled
over his cloak in getting into the carriage, and he had refused
to advertise it except in the local papers.&nbsp; And at that
time the Cheap Jack and Sal were both in London.</p>
<p>But George&rsquo;s incautious speech recalled one or two facts
to them, and whilst George sat slowly endeavoring to realize that
new idea, &ldquo;Master Jan Ford, full young gentleman, and at
least half Frenchman&rdquo; (for of any other foreigners George
knew nothing), the Cheap Jack was pondering the words
&ldquo;five-pound bill,&rdquo; and connecting them with
George&rsquo;s account of his savings when they last met; and his
quicker spouse was also putting two and two together, but with a
larger sum.&nbsp; At the same instant the Cheap Jack inquired
after George&rsquo;s money, and his wife asked about the
letter.&nbsp; But George had hastily come to a decision.&nbsp; If
the tale told by the woman were true, he had got a great deal of
information for nothing, and he saw no reason for sharing
whatever the letter might contain with those most likely to
profit by it.&nbsp; As to letting the Cheap Jack have any thing
whatever to do with the disposal of his savings, nothing could be
further from his intentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gearge bean&rsquo;t such a vool as a looks,&rdquo;
thought that worthy, and aloud he vowed, with unnecessary oaths,
that the money was still in the bank, and that he had forgotten
to bring the letter, which was in a bundle that he had left at
the mill.</p>
<p>This disappointment did not, however, diminish the civility of
the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; She was very hospitable, and
even pressed George to spend the night at their house, which he
declined.&nbsp; He had a dread of the Cheap Jack, which was
almost superstitious.</p>
<p>For her civility, indeed, the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife was
taken to task by her husband in a few moments when they were
alone together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you was sharper than to be took in by
him!&rdquo; said the hunchback, indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
believe all that gag about the bank and the bundle? and you, as
soft to him, telling him every blessed thing, and he stowed the
cash and the letter somewheres where we shall never catch a sight
of &rsquo;em, and got every thing out of you as easy as shelling
a pod of peas.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in language as strong as that of
the miller&rsquo;s man the Cheap Jack swore he could have done
better himself a hundred times over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you?&rdquo; said the large-mouthed woman,
contemptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t live long in the
country, I wouldn&rsquo;t, if it was to make me such a owl as
you&rsquo;ve turned into.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t much farther than
your nose <i>you</i> sees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind me, Sal, my dear,&rdquo; said the hunchback,
anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I trusts you, my dear.&nbsp; And it seems
to me as if you thought he&rsquo;d got &rsquo;em about him.&nbsp;
Do you, my dear, and why?&nbsp; And why did you tell him the
truth, straight on end, when a made-up tale would have done as
well, and kept him in the dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did I tell him the truth?&rdquo; repeated the
woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Cos I ain&rsquo;t such a countrified
fool as to think lies is allus the cleverest tip, &rsquo;cos the
truth went farthest this time.&nbsp; Why do I think he&rsquo;s
got &rsquo;em about him?&nbsp; First, &rsquo;cos he swore so
steady he hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; For a ready lie, and for acting a
lie, and over-acting it at times, give me townspeople; but for a
thundering big un, against all reason, and for sticking to it
stupid when they&rsquo;re downright convicted, and with a face as
innercent as a baby&rsquo;s, give me a country lump.&nbsp; And
next, because I can tell with folks a deal sharper than him, even
to which side of &rsquo;em the pocket is they&rsquo;ve got what
they wants to hide in, by the way they moves their head and their
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which side is it of him, Sal?&rdquo; said the
hunchback, with ugly eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The left,&rdquo; said Sal; &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t be
there long.&rdquo;</p>

STOLEN.&mdash;GEORGE IN THE KING&rsquo;S ARMS.&mdash;GEORGE IN
THE KING&rsquo;S SERVICE.&mdash;THE LETTER CHANGES HANDS, BUT
KEEPS ITS SECRET.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some years the ex-servant of
the windmill had been rather favored by fortune than
otherwise.&nbsp; He found the pocket-book, and, though he could
not read the letter, he got the five-pound note.&nbsp; Since
then, his gains, honest and dishonest, had been much beyond his
needs, and his savings were not small.&nbsp; Suspicion was just
beginning to connect his name and that of the Cheap Jack with
certain thefts committed in the neighborhood, when he made up his
mind to go.</p>
<p>His wealth was not generally known.&nbsp; Many a time had he
been tempted to buy pigs (a common speculation in the district,
and the first stone of more than one rustic fortune), but the
dread of exciting suspicion balanced the almost certain profit,
and he could never make up his mind.&nbsp; For Master Lake paid
only five pounds a year for his man&rsquo;s valuable services,
which, even in a district where at that time habits were simple,
and boots not made of brown paper, did not leave much margin for
the purchase of pigs.&nbsp; The pig speculation, though
profitable, was not safe.&nbsp; George had made money, however,
and he had escaped detection.&nbsp; On the whole, he had been
fortunate.&nbsp; But that mop saw a turn in the tide of his
affairs, and ended strangely with him.</p>
<p>It began otherwise.&nbsp; George had never felt more convinced
of his power to help himself at the expense of his neighbors than
he did after getting Sal&rsquo;s information, and keeping back
his own, before they started to join in the amusements of the
fair.&nbsp; He was on good terms with himself; none the less so
that he had not failed to see the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s chagrin, as
the woman poured forth all she knew for George&rsquo;s benefit,
and got nothing in return.</p>
<p>The vanity of the ignorant knows no check except from without;
under flattery, it is boundless, and the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife
found no difficulty in fooling George to the top of his bent.</p>
<p>George was rather proud, too, of his companion.&nbsp; She was
not, as has been said, ill-looking but for her mouth, and beauty
was not abundant enough in the neighborhood to place her at much
disadvantage.&nbsp; Fashionable finery was even less common, and
the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife was showily dressed.&nbsp; And George
found her a very pleasant companion; much livelier than the
slow-witted damsels of the country-side.&nbsp; For him she had
nothing but flattery; but her smart speeches at the expense of
other people in the crowd caused the miller&rsquo;s man to double
up his long back with laughter.</p>
<p>A large proportion of the country wives and sweethearts
tramped up and down the fair at the heels of their husbands and
swains, like squaws after their Indian spouses.&nbsp; But the
Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife asked George for his arm,&mdash;the left
one,&mdash;and she clung to it all the day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite
the lady in her manners she be,&rdquo; thought George.&nbsp; She
called him &ldquo;Mr. Sannel,&rdquo; too.&nbsp; George felt that
she admired him.&nbsp; For a moment his satisfaction was checked,
when she called his attention to the good looks of a handsome
recruiting sergeant, who was strutting about the mop with an air
expressing not so much that it all belonged to him as that he
didn&rsquo;t at all belong to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there, he ain&rsquo;t to hold a candle to you, Mr.
Sannel, though his coat do sit well upon him,&rdquo; said the
Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>It gratified George&rsquo;s standing ill-will to the Cheap
Jack to have &ldquo;cut him out&rdquo; with this showy lady, and
to laugh loudly with her upon his arm, whilst the hunchback
followed, like a discontented cur, at their heels.&nbsp; If there
was a drawback to the merits of his lively companion, it was her
power of charming the money out of George&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>The money that he disbursed came from the right-hand pocket of
his red waistcoat.&nbsp; In the left-hand pocket (and the
pockets, like the pattern of the waistcoat, were large) was the
lost pocket-book.&nbsp; It was a small one, and just fitted in
nicely.&nbsp; In the pocket-book were George&rsquo;s savings,
chiefly in paper.&nbsp; Notes were more portable than coin, and,
as George meant to invest them somewhere where he was not known,
no suspicions need be raised by their value.&nbsp; The letter was
there also.</p>
<p>There were plenty of shows at the mop, and the Cheap
Jack&rsquo;s wife saw them all.&nbsp; The travelling wax-works;
the menagerie with a very mangy lion in an appallingly rickety
cage; the fat Scotchman, a monster made more horrible to view by
a dress of royal Stuart tartan; the penny theatre, and a mermaid
in a pickling-tub.</p>
<p>One treat only she declined.&nbsp; The miller&rsquo;s man
would have paid for a shilling portrait of her, but she refused
to be taken.</p>
<p>The afternoon was wearing away, when Sal caught sight of some
country bumpkins upon a stage, who were preparing to grin through
horse-collars against each other for the prize of a hat.&nbsp; As
she had never seen or heard of the entertainment, George
explained it to her.</p>
<p>It was a contest in which the ugliest won the prize.&nbsp;
Only the widest-mouthed, most grotesque-looking clowns of the
place attempted to compete; and he won who, besides being the
ugliest by nature, could &ldquo;grin&rdquo; and contort his
features in the mode which most tickled the fancy of the
beholders.&nbsp; George had once competed himself, and had only
failed to secure the hat because his nearest rival could squint
as well as grin; and he was on the point of boasting of this, but
on second thoughts he kept the fact to himself.</p>
<p>Very willing indeed he was to escort his companion to a show
in the open air for which nothing was charged, and they plunged
valiantly into the crowd.&nbsp; The crowd was huge, but
George&rsquo;s height and strength stood him in good stead, and
he pushed on, and dragged Sal with him.&nbsp; There was some
confusion on the stage.&nbsp; A nigger, with a countenance which
of itself moved the populace to roars of laughter, had applied to
be allowed to compete.&nbsp; Opinions were divided as to whether
it would be fair to native talent, whilst there was a strong
desire to see a face that in its natural condition was &ldquo;as
good as a play,&rdquo; with the additional attractions of a
horse-collar and a grin.</p>
<p>The country clowns on the stage fumed, and the nigger grinned
and bowed, and the crowd yelled, and surged, and swayed, and weak
people got trampled, and everybody was tightly squeezed, and the
Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife was alarmed, and withdrew her hand from
George&rsquo;s arm, and begged him to hold her up, which he
gallantly did, she meanwhile clinging with both hands to his
smock.</p>
<p>As to the hunchback, it is hardly necessary to say that he did
not get very far into the crowd, and when his wife and George
returned, laughing gayly, they found him standing outside, with a
sulky face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look here, missus,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re a enjoying of yourself, but I&rsquo;m
not.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got the blunt, so just hand over a few
coppers, and I&rsquo;ll get a pint at the King&rsquo;s
Arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sal began fumbling to find her pocket, but when she found it,
she gave a shriek, and turned it inside out.&nbsp; It was
empty!</p>
<p>If the miller&rsquo;s man had enjoyed himself before, he was
not to be envied now.&nbsp; The Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife poured
forth her woes in a continuous stream of complaint.&nbsp; She
minutely described the purse which she had lost, the age and
quality of her dress, and the impossibility of there being a hole
in her pocket.&nbsp; She took George&rsquo;s arm once more, and
insisted upon revisiting every stall and show where they had
been, to see if her purse had been found.&nbsp; Up and down
George toiled with her, wiping his face and feeling that he
looked like a fool, as at each place in turn they were told that
they might as well &ldquo;look for a needle in a bottle of
hay,&rdquo; and that pickpockets were as plenty at a mop as
blackberries in September.</p>
<p>He was tired of the woman now she was troublesome, and
fidgetingly persevering, as women are apt to be, and he was vexed
to feel how little money was left in his right-hand pocket.&nbsp;
He did not think of feeling in the left one, not merely because
the Cheap Jack was standing in front of him, but because no fear
for the safety of its contents had dawned upon him.&nbsp; It was
easy for a woman to lose her purse out of a pocket flapping
loosely in the drapery of her skirts, but that any thing stowed
tightly away in a man&rsquo;s waistcoat under his smock could be
stolen in broad daylight without his knowledge did not occur to
him.&nbsp; As little did he guess that of all the pickpockets who
were supposed to drive a brisk trade at the fair, the quickest,
the cleverest, the most practised professional was the Cheap
Jack&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>She had feigned to see &ldquo;something&rdquo; on the ground
near an oyster stall, which she said &ldquo;might be&rdquo; her
purse.&nbsp; As indeed it might as well as any thing else, seeing
that the said purse had no existence.</p>
<p>As she left them, George turned to the Cheap Jack.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee here, Jack,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;take
thee missus whoam.&nbsp; She do seem to be so put about,
&rsquo;tis no manner of use her stopping in the mop.&nbsp; And I
be off for a pint of something to wash my throat out.&nbsp; I be
mortal dry with running up and down after she.&nbsp; Women does
make such a caddle about things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might stand a pint for an old friend, George, my
dear,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack, following him.&nbsp; But George
hurried on, and shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;tak&rsquo; thee missus whoam, I tell &rsquo;ee.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ve not seen much at your expense to-day, if she have
lost her pus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which the miller&rsquo;s man escaped into the
King&rsquo;s Arms, and pushed his way to the farthest end of the
room, where a large party of men were drinking and smoking.</p>
<p>At a table near him sat the recruiting sergeant whom he had
noticed before, and he now examined him more closely.</p>
<p>He was of a not uncommon type of non-commissioned officers in
the English service.&nbsp; Not of a very
intellectual&mdash;hardly perhaps of an interesting&mdash;kind of
good looks, he was yet a strikingly handsome man.&nbsp; His
features were good and clearly cut; his hair and moustache were
dark, thick, short and glossy; his dark eyes were quick and
bright; his figure was well-made, and better developed; his
shapely hands were not only clean, they were fastidiously trimmed
about the nails (a daintiness common below the rank of sergeant,
especially among men acting as clerks); and if the stone in his
signet ring was not a real onyx, it looked quite as well at a
distance, and the absence of a crest was not conspicuous.&nbsp;
He spoke with a very good imitation of the accent of the officers
he had served with, and in his alertness, his well-trained
movements, his upright carriage, and his personal cleanliness, he
came so near to looking like a gentleman that he escaped it only
by a certain swagger, which proved an ill-chosen substitute for
well-bred ease.</p>
<p>To George&rsquo;s eyes this was not visible as a fault.&nbsp;
The sergeant was as much &ldquo;the swell&rdquo; as George could
imagine any man to be.</p>
<p>George Sannel could never remember with distinctness the
ensuing events of that afternoon.&nbsp; Dim memories remained
with him of the sergeant meeting his long stare with some
civilities, to which he was conscious of having replied less
suitably than he might have wished.&nbsp; At one period,
certainly, bets were made upon the height of himself and the
handsome soldier, respectively, and he was sure that they were
put back to back, and that he proved the taller man; and that it
was somehow impressed upon him that he did not look so, because
the other carried himself so much better.&nbsp; It was also
impressed upon him, somehow, that if he would consent to be
well-dressed, well-fed, and well-lodged, at the expense of the
country, his own appearance would quickly rival that of the
sergeant, and that the reigning Sovereign would gladly pay, as
well as keep and clothe, such an ornamental bulwark of the
state.&nbsp; At some other period the sergeant had undoubtedly
told him to &ldquo;give it a name,&rdquo; and the name he gave it
was sixpenny ale, which he drank at the sergeant&rsquo;s expense,
and which was followed by shandy-gaff, on the same footing.</p>
<p>At what time and for what reason George put his hand into his
left-hand waistcoat pocket he never could remember.&nbsp; But
when he did so, and found it empty, the cry he raised had such a
ring of anguish as might have awakened pity for him, even where
his ill deeds were fully known.</p>
<p>The position was perplexing, if he had had a sober head to
consider it with.&nbsp; That pickpockets abounded had been well
impressed upon his slow intellect, and that there was no means of
tracing property so lost, in the crowd and confusion of the
mop.&nbsp; True, his property was worth &ldquo;crying,&rdquo;
worth offering a reward for.&nbsp; But the pocket-book was not
his, and the letter was not addressed to him; and it was doubtful
if he even dare run the risk of claiming them.</p>
<p>His first despair was succeeded by a sort of drunken fury, in
which he accused the men sitting with him of robbing him, and
then swore it was the Cheap Jack, and so raved till the landlord
of the King&rsquo;s Arms expelled him as &ldquo;drunk and
disorderly,&rdquo; and most of the company refused to believe
that he had had any such sum of money to lose.</p>
<p>Exactly how or where, after this, the sergeant found him,
George could not remember, but his general impression of the
sergeant&rsquo;s kindness was strong.&nbsp; He could recall that
he pumped upon his head in the yard of the King&rsquo;s Arms, to
sober him, by George&rsquo;s own request; and that it did
somewhat clear his brain, his remembrance of seeing the sergeant
wipe his fingers on a cambric handkerchief seems to prove.&nbsp;
They then paced up and down together arm in arm, if not as
accurately in step as might have been agreeable to the
soldier.&nbsp; George remembered hearing of prize money, to which
his own loss was a bagatelle, and gathering on the whole that the
army, as a profession, opened a sort of boundless career of
opportunities to a man of his peculiar talents and
appearance.&nbsp; There was something infectious, too, in the gay
easy style in which the soldier seemed to treat fortune, good or
ill; and the miller&rsquo;s man was stimulated at last to vow
that he was not such a fool as he looked, and would &ldquo;never
say die.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the best of his belief, the sergeant
replied in terms which showed that, had he been &ldquo;in
cash,&rdquo; George&rsquo;s loss would have been made good by
him, out of pure generosity, and on the spot.</p>
<p>As it was, he pressed upon his acceptance the sum of one
shilling, which the miller&rsquo;s man pocketed with tears.</p>
<p>What recruit can afterwards remember which argument of the
skilful sergeant did most to melt his discretion into valor?</p>
<p>The sun had not dried the dew from the wolds, and the sails of
the windmill hung idle in the morning air, when George Sannel
made his first march to the drums and fifes, with ribbons flying
from his hat, a recruit of the 206th (Royal Wiltshire) Regiment
of Foot.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As the Cheap Jack and his wife hastened home from the mop, Sal
had some difficulty in restraining her husband&rsquo;s impatience
to examine the pocket-book as they walked along.</p>
<p>Prudence prevailed, however, and it was not opened till they
were at home and alone.</p>
<p>In notes and money, George&rsquo;s savings amounted to more
than thirteen pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well, my dear,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack,
grinning hideously.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now for the letter.&nbsp;
Read it aloud, Sal, my dear; you&rsquo;re a better scholar than
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sal opened the thin, well-worn sheet, and read the word
&ldquo;Moerdyk,&rdquo; but then she paused.&nbsp; And, like Abel,
she paused so long that the hunchback pressed impatiently to look
over her shoulder.</p>
<p>But the letter was written in a foreign language, and the
Cheap Jack and his wife were no wiser for it than the
miller&rsquo;s man.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">MIDSUMMER
HOLIDAYS.&mdash;CHILD FANCIES.&mdash;JAN AND THE
PIG-MINDER.&mdash;MASTER SALTER AT HOME.&mdash;JAN HIRES HIMSELF
OUT.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Midsummer</span> came, and the
Dame&rsquo;s school broke up for the holidays.&nbsp; Jan had
longed for them intensely.&nbsp; Not that he was oppressed by the
labors of learning, but that he wanted to be out of doors.&nbsp;
Many a little one was equally eager for the freedom of the
fields, but the common child-love for hedges and ditches, and
flower-picking, and the like, was intensified in Jan by a deeper
pleasure which country scenes awoke from the artist nature within
him.&nbsp; That it is no empty sentimentality to speak of an
artist nature in a child, let the child-memories of all artists
bear witness!&nbsp; That they inspired the poet Wordsworth with
one of his best poems, and that they have dyed the canvas of most
landscape painters with the indestructible local coloring of the
scenes of each man&rsquo;s childhood, will hardly be denied.</p>
<p>That this is against the wishes and the theories of many
excellent people has nothing to do with its truth.&nbsp; If all
children were the bluff, hearty, charmingly naughty, enviably
happy, utterly simple and unsentimental beings that some of us
wish, and so assert them to be, it might be better for them, or
it might not&mdash;who can say?&nbsp; That the healthy, careless,
rough and ready type is the one to encourage, many will agree,
who cannot agree that it is universal, or even much the most
common.&nbsp; It is probably from an imperfect remembrance of
their nursery lives that some people believe that the griefs of
one&rsquo;s childhood are light, its joys uncomplicated, and its
tastes simple.&nbsp; A clearer recollection of the favorite
poetry and the most cherished day-dreams of very early years
would probably convince them that the strongest taste for tragedy
comes before one&rsquo;s teens, and inclines to the melodramatic;
that sentimentality (of some kind) is grateful to the verge of
mawkishness; and that simple tastes are rather a result of
culture and experience than natural gifts of infancy.</p>
<p>But in this rummaging up of the crude tastes, the hot little
opinions, the romance, the countless visions, the many
affectations of nursery days, there will be recalled also a very
real love of nature; varying, of course, in its intensity from a
mere love of fresh air and free romping, and a destructive taste
for nosegays, to a living romance about the daily walks of the
imaginative child,&mdash;a world apart, peopled with invisible
company, such as fairies, and those fancy friends which some
children devise for themselves, or with the beasts and flowers,
to which love has given a personality.</p>
<p>To the romance child-fancy weaves for itself about the meadows
where the milkmaids stand thick and pale, and those green courts
where lords and ladies live, Jan added that world of pleasure
open to those gifted with a keen sense of form and color.&nbsp;
Strange gleams under a stormy sky, sunshine on some
kingfisher&rsquo;s plumage rising from the river, and all the
ever-changing beauties about him, stirred his heart with emotions
that he could not have defined.</p>
<p>There was much to see even from Dame Datchett&rsquo;s open
door, but there was more to be imagined.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s envy
of the pig-minder had reached a great height when the last
school-day came.</p>
<p>He wanted to be free by the time that the pig-herd brought his
pigs to water, and his wishes were fulfilled.&nbsp; The
Dame&rsquo;s flock and the flock of the swineherd burst at one
and the same moment into the water-meadows, and Jan was soon in
conversation with the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee likes pig-minding, I reckon?&rdquo; said Jan,
stripping the leaves from a sallywithy wand, which he had picked
to imitate that of the swineherd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; said the large-coated urchin, wiping his
face with the big sleeve of his blue coat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s aal thee knows about un.&nbsp; I be going to
leave to-morrow, I be.&nbsp; And if so be Master Salter&rsquo;s
got another bwoy, or if so be he&rsquo;s not, I dunno, it
ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan learned that he had eighteen pence a week for driving the
pigs to a wood at some little distance, where they fed on acorns,
beech-mast, etc.; for giving them water, keeping them together,
and bringing them home at teatime.&nbsp; He allowed that he could
drive them as slowly as he pleased, and that they kept pretty
well together in the wood; but that, as a whole, the perversity
of pigs was such that&mdash;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, wait till ee
tries it theeself, Jan Lake, that&rsquo;s aal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan had resolved to do so.&nbsp; He did not return with his
foster-brothers to the mill.&nbsp; He slipped off on one of his
solitary expeditions, and made his way to the farm-house of
Master Salter.</p>
<p>Master Salter and his wife sat at tea in the kitchen.&nbsp; In
the cheerful clatter of cups, they had failed to hear Jan&rsquo;s
knock; but the sunshine streaming through the open doorway being
broken by some small body, the farmer&rsquo;s wife looked hastily
up, thinking that the new-born calf had got loose, and was on the
threshold.</p>
<p>But it was Jan.&nbsp; The outer curls of his hair gleamed in
the sunlight like an aureole about his face.&nbsp; He had doffed
his hat, out of civility, and he held it in one hand, whilst with
the other he fingered the slate that hung at his waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Massey upon us!&rdquo; said the farmer, looking up at
the same instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who be thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan Lake, the miller&rsquo;s son, maester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in!&rdquo; cried Master Salter,
hospitably.&nbsp; &ldquo;So Master Lake have sent thee with a
message, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father didn&rsquo;t send me,&rdquo; said Jan,
gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come myself.&nbsp; Do &rsquo;ee want a
pig-minder, Master Salter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, I wants a pig-minder.&nbsp; But I reckon thee
father can&rsquo;t spare Abel for that now.&nbsp; A wish he
could.&nbsp; Abel was careful with the pigs, he was, and a sprack
boy, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful, main careful, Master
Salter,&rdquo; said Jan, earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I likes
pigs.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the farmer was pondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan Lake&mdash;Jan,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be
thee the boy as draad out the sow and her pigs for Master
Chuter&rsquo;s little gel?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jan nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor massey!&rdquo; cried Master Salter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo; told&rsquo;ee, missus, about un.&nbsp; Look here,
Jan Lake.&nbsp; If thee&rsquo;ll draa me out some pigs like them,
I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;ee sixpence and a new slate, and
I&rsquo;ll try thee for a week, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Jan drew the slate-pencil from his pocket without reply.&nbsp;
Mrs. Salter, who had been watching him with motherly eyes, pushed
a small stool towards him, and he began to draw a scene such as
he had been studying daily for months past,&mdash;pigs at the
water-side.&nbsp; He had made dozens of such sketches.&nbsp; But
the delight of the farmer knew no bounds.&nbsp; He slapped his
knees, he laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and, as Jan
put a very wicked eye into the face of the hindmost pig, he
laughed merrily also.&nbsp; He was not insensible of his own
talents, and the stimulus of the farmer&rsquo;s approbation gave
vigor to his strokes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, missus,&rdquo; cried Master Salter; &ldquo;get
down our Etherd&rsquo;s new slate, and give it to un; I&rsquo;ll
get another for he.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s the sixpence, Jan;
and if thee minds pigs as well as &rsquo;ee draas &rsquo;em, I
don&rsquo;t care how long &rsquo;ee minds mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The object of his visit being now accomplished, Jan took up
his hat to depart, but an important omission struck him, and he
turned to say, &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ee give me for minding
your pigs, Master Salter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Salter was economical, and Jan was small, and anxious
for the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shilling a week,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his tea?&rdquo; the missus gently suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Master
Salter.&nbsp; &ldquo;A shilling a week and thee tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan paused.&nbsp; His predecessor had had eighteen pence for
very imperfect services.&nbsp; Jan meant to be beyond reproach,
and felt himself worth quite as much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give the other boy one and sixpence,&rdquo; said the
farmer, &ldquo;but thee&rsquo;s very small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sprack,&rdquo; said Jan, confidently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I be fond of pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Massey upon me,&rdquo; said Master Salter, laughing
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a peart young toad,
sartinly.&nbsp; A might be fifty year old, for the ways of
un.&nbsp; Well, thee shall have a shilling and thee tea, or one
and sixpence without, then.&rdquo;&nbsp; And seeing that Jan
glanced involuntarily at the table, the farmer added, &ldquo;Give
un some now, missus.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll lay a pound bill the child
be hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan was hungry.&nbsp; He had bartered the food from his
&ldquo;nunchin bag&rdquo; at dinner-time for another
child&rsquo;s new slate-pencil.&nbsp; The cakes were very good,
too, and Mrs. Salter was liberal.&nbsp; He rose greatly in her
esteem by saying grace before meat.&nbsp; He cooled his tea in
his saucer too, and raised it to his lips with his little finger
stuck stiffly out (a mark of gentility imparted by Mrs. Lake),
and in all points conducted himself with the utmost
propriety.&nbsp; &ldquo;For what we have received the Lord be
praised,&rdquo; was his form of giving thanks; to which Mrs.
Salter added, &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bless his
heart!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Jan, picking up his hat, lifted his dark
eyes candidly to the farmer&rsquo;s face, and said with much
gravity and decision,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a shilling a week and me tea, Master
Salter, if it be all the same to you.&nbsp; And thank you kindly,
sir, and the missus likewise.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE BLUE
COAT.&mdash;PIG-MINDING AND
TREE-STUDYING.&mdash;LEAF-PAINTINGS.&mdash;A
STRANGER.&mdash;MASTER SWIFT IS DISAPPOINTED.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Jan returned to the windmill,
and gravely announced that he had hired himself out as pig-minder
to Master Salter, Mrs. Lake was, as she said, &ldquo;put
about.&rdquo;&nbsp; She considered pig-minding quite beneath the
dignity of her darling, and brought forward every objection she
could think of except the real one.&nbsp; But the windmiller had
no romantic dreams on Jan&rsquo;s behalf, and he decided that
&ldquo;&rsquo;twas better he should be arning a shillin&rsquo; a
week than gettin&rsquo; into mischief at whoam.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Jan&rsquo;s ambition, however, was not satisfied.&nbsp; He wanted
a blue coat, such as is worn by the shepherd-boys on the
plains.&nbsp; He did not mind how old it was, but it must be
large; long in the skirt and sleeves.&nbsp; He had woven such a
romance about Master Salter&rsquo;s swineherd and his life, as he
watched him week after week from Dame Datchett&rsquo;s door with
envious eyes, that even his coat, with the tails almost sweeping
the ground, seemed to Jan to have a dignified air.&nbsp; And
there really was something to be said in favor of sleeves so long
that he could turn them back into a huge cuff in summer, and turn
them down, Chinese fashion, over his hands in winter, to keep
them warm.</p>
<p>Such a blue coat Abel had possessed, but it was not suitable
for mill work, and Mrs. Lake was easily persuaded to give it to
Jan.&nbsp; He refused to have it curtailed, or in any way adapted
to his figure, and in it, with a switch of his own cutting, he
presented himself at Master Salter&rsquo;s farm in good time the
following morning.</p>
<p>It could not be said that Jan&rsquo;s predecessor had
exaggerated the perversity of the pigs he drove.&nbsp; If the
coat of his choice had a fault in Jan&rsquo;s estimation, it was
that it helped to make him very hot as he ran hither and thither
after his flock.&nbsp; But he had not studied pig-nature in
vain.&nbsp; He had a good deal of sympathy with its vagaries, and
he was quite able to outwit the pigs.&nbsp; Indeed, a curious
attachment grew up between the little swineherd and his flock,
some of whom would come at his call, when he rewarded their
affection, as he had gained it, by scratching their backs with a
rough stick.</p>
<p>But there were times when their playful and errant
peculiarities were no small annoyance to him.&nbsp; Jan was
growing fast both in mind and body.&nbsp; Phases of taste and
occupation succeed each other very rapidly when one is young; and
there are, perhaps, no more distinct phases, more sudden strides,
than in the art of painting.&nbsp; With Jan the pig phase was
going, and it was followed by landscape-sketching.</p>
<p>Jan was drawing his pigs one day in the little wood, when he
fancied that the gnarled elbow of a branch near him had, in its
outline, some likeness to a pig&rsquo;s face, and he began to
sketch it on his slate.&nbsp; But in studying the tree the
grotesque likeness was forgotten, and there burst upon his mind,
as a revelation, the sense of that world of beauty which lies
among stems and branches, twigs and leaves.&nbsp; Painfully, but
with happy pains, he traced the branch joint by joint, curve by
curve, as it spread from the parent stem and tapered to its last
delicate twigs.&nbsp; It was like following a river from its
source to the sea.&nbsp; But to that sea of summer sky, in which
the final ramifications of his branch were lost, Jan did not
reach.&nbsp; He was abruptly stopped by the edge of his slate,
which would hold no more.</p>
<p>To remedy this, when next he drew trees, he began the branches
from the outer tips, and worked inwards to the stem.&nbsp; It was
done for convenience, but to this habit he used afterwards to lay
some of the merit of his admirable touch in tree-painting.&nbsp;
And so &ldquo;pig-making&rdquo; became an amusement of the past,
and the spell of the woods fell on Jan.</p>
<p>It was no very wonderful wood either, this one where he first
herded pigs and studied trees.&nbsp; It was composed chiefly of
oaks and beeches, none of them of very grand proportions.&nbsp;
But it was little cut and little trodden.&nbsp; The
bramble-bowers were unbroken, the leaf-mould was deep and rich,
and a very tiny stream, which trickled out of sight, kept mosses
ever green about its bed.&nbsp; The whole wood was fragrant with
honeysuckle, which pushed its way everywhere, and gay with other
wild flowers.&nbsp; But the trees were Jan&rsquo;s delight.&nbsp;
He would lie on his back and gaze up into them with unwearying
pleasure.&nbsp; He looked at his old etching with new interest,
to see how the artist had done the branches of the willows by the
water-mill.&nbsp; And then he would get Abel to put a very sharp
point to his own slate-pencil, and would go back to the real oaks
and beeches, which were so difficult and yet so fascinating to
him.</p>
<p>He was very happy in the wood, with two drawbacks.&nbsp; The
pigs would stray when he became absorbed in his sketching, and
the slate and slate-pencil, which did very well to draw pigs in
outline, were miserable implements, when more than half the
beauty of the subject to be represented was in its color.&nbsp;
For the first evil there was no remedy but to give chase.&nbsp;
Out of the second came an amusement in favor of which even the
beloved slate hung idle.</p>
<p>In watching beautiful bits of coloring in the wood, contrasted
greens of many hues, some jutting branch with yellowish foliage
caught by the sun, and relieved by a distance of blue grays
beyond,&mdash;colors and contrasts which only grew lovelier as
the heavy green of midsummer was broken by the inroad of autumnal
tints,&mdash;Jan noticed also that among the fallen leaves at his
feet there were some of nearly every color in the foliage
above.&nbsp; At first it was by a sort of idle trick that he
matched one against the other, as a lady sorts silks for her
embroidery; then he arranged bits of the leaves upon the outline
on his slate, and then, the slate being too small, he amused
himself by grouping the leaves upon the path in front of him into
woodland scenes.&nbsp; The idea had been partly suggested to him
by a bottle which stood on Mrs. Salter&rsquo;s mantelpiece,
containing colored sands arranged into landscapes; a work of art
sent by Mrs. Salter&rsquo;s sister from the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>The slate would have been quite unused, but for the
difficulties Jan got into with his outlines.&nbsp; At last he
adopted the plan of making a sketch upon his slate, which he then
laid beside him on the walk, and copied it in leaves.&nbsp; More
perishable even than the pig-drawings, the evening breeze
generally cast these paintings to the winds, but none the less
was Jan happy with them, and sometimes in quiet weather, or a
sheltered nook, they remained undisturbed for days.</p>
<p>Dame Datchett&rsquo;s school reopened, but Jan would not leave
his pigs.&nbsp; He took the shilling faithfully home each week to
his foster-mother.&nbsp; She found it very useful, and she had no
very high ideas about education.&nbsp; She had some twinges of
conscience in the matter, but she had no strength of purpose, and
Jan went his own way.</p>
<p>The tints had grown very warm on trees and leaves, when Jan
one day accomplished, with much labor, the best painting he had
yet done.&nbsp; It was of a scene before his eyes.&nbsp; The
trees were admirably grouped; he put little bits of twigs for the
branches, which now showed more than hitherto, and he added a
glimpse of the sky by neatly dovetailing the petals of some
bluebells into a mosaic.&nbsp; He had turned back the long
sleeves of his coat, and had with difficulty kept the tail of it
from doing damage to his foreground, and had perseveringly kept
the pigs at bay, when, as he returned with a last instalment of
bluebells to finish his sky, he saw a man standing on the path,
with his back to him, completely blotting out the view by his
very broad body, and with one heel not half an inch from
Jan&rsquo;s picture.</p>
<p>He was a coarsely built old man, dressed in threadbare
black.&nbsp; The tones of his voice were broad, and quite unlike
the local dialect.&nbsp; He was speaking as Jan came up, but to
no companion that Jan could see, though his hand was outstretched
in sympathy with his words.&nbsp; He was looking upwards, too, as
Jan was wont to look himself, into that azure sky which he was
trying to paint in bluebell flowers.</p>
<p>In truth, the stranger was spouting poetry, and poems and
recitations were alike unknown to Jan; but something caught his
fancy in what he heard, and the flowers dropped from his fingers
as the broad but not ungraceful accents broke upon his
ear:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The clouds were pure and white as flocks
new shorn,<br />
And fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept<br />
On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept<br />
A little noiseless noise among the leaves,<br />
Born of the very sigh that silence heaves;<br />
For not the faintest motion could be seen<br />
Of all the shades that slanted o&rsquo;er the green.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old man paused for an instant, and, turning round, saw
Jan, and put his heavy foot into the sky of Jan&rsquo;s
picture.&nbsp; He drew it back at Jan&rsquo;s involuntary cry,
and, after a long look at the quaint figure before him, said,
&ldquo;Are ye one of the fairies, little man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jan knew nothing of fairies.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be Jan Lake,
from the mill,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye so?&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not a miller&rsquo;s
coat ye&rsquo;ve on,&rdquo; said the old man, with a twinkle in
his eye.</p>
<p>Jan looked seriously at it, and then explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
be Master Salter&rsquo;s pig-minder just now, but I&rsquo;ve got
a miller&rsquo;s thumb, I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well, Master Pig-minder; and now would ye
tell an old man what ye screamed out for.&nbsp; Did I scare
ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; said Jan, civilly; and he added,
&ldquo;I liked that you were saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye a bit of a poet as well as a pig-minder,
then?&rdquo; and waving his hand with a theatrical gesture up the
wood, the old man began to spout afresh:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A filbert hedge with wild briar
overtwined,<br />
And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind<br />
Upon their summer thrones; there too should be<br />
The frequent chequer of a youngling tree,<br />
That with a score of light green brethren shoots<br />
From the quaint mossiness of aged roots:<br />
Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters<br />
Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters,<br />
The spreading bluebells; it may haply mourn<br />
That such fair clusters should be rudely torn<br />
From their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly<br />
By infant hands, left on the path to die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the strange dialect and the unfamiliar terseness of
poetry, Jan did not follow this very clearly, but he caught the
allusion to bluebells, and the old man brought his hand back to
his side with a gesture so expressive towards the bluebell
fragments at his feet, that it hardly needed the tone of reproach
he gave to the last few words&mdash;&ldquo;left on the path to
die&rdquo;&mdash;to make Jan hang his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the only blue I could find,&rdquo; he said,
looking ruefully at the fading flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what for did ye want blue, then, my lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make the sky with,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The powers of the air be good to us!&rdquo; said the
stranger, setting his broad hat back from his face, as if to
obtain a clearer view of the little pig-minder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are
ye a sky-maker as well as a swineherd?&nbsp; And while I&rsquo;m
catechising ye, may I ask for what do ye bring a slate out
pig-minding and sky-making?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I draws out the trees on it first,&rdquo; said Jan,
&ldquo;and then I does them in leaves.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll come
round,&rdquo; he added, shyly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll see it.&nbsp;
But don&rsquo;t tread on un, please, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man fumbled in his pocket, from which he drew a
shagreen spectacle-case, as substantial looking as himself, and,
planting the spectacles firmly on his heavy nose, he held out his
hand to Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take me where ye
will.&nbsp; To bonnie Elf-land, if that&rsquo;s your road, where
withered leaves are gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan ran round willingly to take the hand of his new
friend.&nbsp; He felt a strange attraction towards him.&nbsp; His
speech was puzzling and had a tone of mockery, but his face was
unmistakably kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, lad, which path do we go by?&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one,&rdquo; said Jan, gazing up at
the old man, as if by very staring with his black eyes he could
come to understand him.&nbsp; But in an instant he was spouting
again, holding Jan before him with one hand, whilst he used the
other as a sort of <i>b&acirc;ton</i> to his speech:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And know&rsquo;st thou not yon broad, broad
road<br />
That lies across the lily levin?<br />
That is the path of sinfulness,<br />
Though some think it the way to heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, please!&rdquo; Jan cried, as the old man
paused.&nbsp; His rugged speech seemed plainer in the lines it
suited so well, and a touch of enthusiasm in his voice increased
the charm.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And know&rsquo;st thou not that narrow
path<br />
So thick beset with thorns and briars?<br />
It is the path of righteousness,<br />
And after it but few aspires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And know&rsquo;st thou not the little path<br />
That winds about the ferny brae?<br />
That is the road to bonnie Elf-land,<br />
Where thou and I this night maun gae.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; said Jan, earnestly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is&rsquo;t a town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking it would
be well to let that path be, in your company.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d
hardly get out under a year and a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go&mdash;with you,&rdquo; said Jan,
confidently.&nbsp; Many an expedition had he undertaken on his
own responsibility, and why not this?</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, show me what ye were going to show me,&rdquo;
said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s this sky
you&rsquo;ve been manufacturing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the ground, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the ground!&nbsp; And are ye for turning earth into
heaven among your other trades?&rdquo;&nbsp; What this might mean
Jan knew not; but he led his friend round, and pointed out the
features of his leaf-picture.&nbsp; He hoped for praise, but the
old man was silent,&mdash;long silent, though he seemed to be
looking at what Jan showed him.&nbsp; And when he did speak, his
broken words were addressed to no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful! wonderful!&nbsp; The poetry of
&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no child&rsquo;s play, this.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s genius.&nbsp; Ay! we mun see to it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then, with clasped hands, he cried, &ldquo;Good Lord!&nbsp; Have
I found him at last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lost something?&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>But the old man did not answer.&nbsp; He did not even speak of
the leaf-picture, to Jan&rsquo;s chagrin.&nbsp; But, stroking the
boy&rsquo;s shoulder almost tenderly, he asked, &ldquo;Did ye
ever go to school, laddie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;At Dame Datchett&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! ye were sorry to leave school for pig-minding,
weren&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I likes pigs,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I axed Master Salter to let me mind his.&nbsp; I
gets a shilling a week and me tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ye like school better?&nbsp; Ye love your books,
don&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan shook his head again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
school,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I likes being in the
wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man winced as if some one had struck him in the face,
then he muttered, &ldquo;The wood!&nbsp; Ay, to be sure!&nbsp;
And such a school, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he suddenly addressed Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do ye know me, my
lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swift&mdash;Master Swift, they call me.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve heard tell of Master Swift, the
schoolmaster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan shrank back.&nbsp; He had heard of Master Swift as a man
whose stick was more to be dreaded than Dame Datchett&rsquo;s
strap, and of his school as a place where liberty was less than
with the Dame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See thee!&rdquo; said the old man, speaking broader and
broader in his earnestness.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thy father would send
thee,&mdash;nay, what am I saying?&mdash;if I took thee for
naught and gladly, thou&rsquo;dst sooner come to the old
schoolmaster and his books than stay with pigs, even in a
wood?&nbsp; Eh, laddie?&nbsp; Will ye come to school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the tradition of Master Swift&rsquo;s severity was strong
in Jan&rsquo;s mind, and the wood was pleasant to him, and he
only shrank back farther, and said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Children often give pain to their elders, of the intensity of
which they have no measure; but, had Jan been older and wiser
than he was, he might have been puzzled by the bitterness of the
disappointment written on Master Swift&rsquo;s countenance.</p>
<p>An involuntary impulse made the old man break the blow by
doing something.&nbsp; With trembling fingers he folded his
spectacles, and crammed them into the shagreen case.&nbsp; But,
when that was done, he still found nothing to say, and he turned
his back and went away in silence.</p>
<p>In silence Jan watched him, half regretfully, and strained his
ears to catch something that Master Swift began again to
recite:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Things
sort not to my will,<br />
Even when my will doth study Thy renown:<br />
Thou turn&rsquo;st the edge of all things on me still,<br />
Taking me up to throw me down.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, lifting a heavy bramble that had fallen across his path,
the schoolmaster stooped under it, and passed from sight.</p>
<p>And a sudden gust of wind coming sharply down the way by which
he went caught the fragments of Jan&rsquo;s picture, and whirled
them broadcast through the wood.</p>

154</span>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">SQUIRE AMMABY AND HIS
DAUGHTER.&mdash;THE CHEAP JACK DOES BUSINESS ONCE MORE.&mdash;THE
WHITE HORSE CHANGES MASTERS.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Squire Ammaby</span> was the most
good-natured of men.&nbsp; He was very fond of his wife, though
she was somewhat peevish, with weak health and nerves, and though
she seemed daily less able to bear the rough and ready attentions
of her husband, and to rely more and more on the advice and
assistance of her mother, Lady Craikshaw.&nbsp; From this it came
about that the Squire&rsquo;s affection for his wife took the
shape of wishing Lady Louisa to have every thing that she wished
for, and that the very joy of his heart was his little daughter
Amabel.</p>
<p>Amabel was between three and four years old, and to some
extent a prodigy.&nbsp; She was as tall as an average child of
six or seven, and stout in proportion.&nbsp; The size of her
shoes scandalized her grandmother, and once drew tears from Lady
Louisa as she reflected on the probable size of Miss
Ammaby&rsquo;s feet by the time she was
&ldquo;presented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Louisa was tall and weedy; the Squire was tall and
robust.&nbsp; Amabel inherited height on both sides, but in face
and in character she was more like her father than her
mother.&nbsp; Indeed, Lady Louisa would close her eyes, and Lady
Craikshaw would put up her gold glass at the child, and they
would both cry, &ldquo;Sadly coarse!&nbsp; <i>Quite an
Ammaby</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Amabel was not coarse, however; but she
had a strength and originality of character that must have come
from some bygone generation, if it was inherited.&nbsp; She had a
pitying affection for her mother.&nbsp; With her grandmother she
lived at daggers drawn.&nbsp; She kept up a pretty successful
struggle for her own way in the nursery.&nbsp; She was devoted to
her father, when she could get at him, and she poured an almost
boundless wealth of affection on every animal that came in her
way.</p>
<p>An uncle had just given her a Spanish saddle, and her father
had promised to buy her a donkey.&nbsp; He had heard of one, and
was going to drive to the town to see the owner.&nbsp; With great
difficulty Amabel had got permission from her mother and
grandmother to go with the Squire in the pony carriage.&nbsp; As
she had faithfully promised to &ldquo;be good,&rdquo; she
submitted to be &ldquo;well wrapped up,&rdquo; under her
grandmother&rsquo;s direction, and staggered downstairs in coat,
cape, gaiters, comforter, muffatees, and with a Shetland veil
over her burning cheeks.&nbsp; She even displayed a needless zeal
by carrying a big shawl in a lump in her arms, which she would
give up to no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she cried, as the Squire tried to take
it from her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lift me in, daddy, lift me
in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Squire laughed, and obeyed her, saying, &ldquo;Why, bless
my soul, Amabel, I think you grow heavier every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amabel came up crimson from some disposal of the shawl after
her own ideas, and her eyes twinkled as he spoke, though her fat
cheeks kept their gravity.&nbsp; It was not till they were far on
their way that a voice from below the seat cried,
&ldquo;Yap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s one of the dogs in the
carriage,&rdquo; said the Squire.</p>
<p>On which, clinging to one of his arms and caressing him,
Amabel confessed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the pug, dear
daddy.&nbsp; I brought him in under the shawl.&nbsp; I did so
want him to have a treat too.&nbsp; And grandmamma is so
hard!&nbsp; She hardly thinks I ought to have treats, and she
<i>never</i> thinks of treats for the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Squire only laughed, and said she must take care of the
dog when they got to the town; and Amabel was encouraged to ask
if she might take off the Shetland veil.&nbsp; Hesitating between
his fear of Amabel&rsquo;s catching cold, and a common-sense
conviction that it was ludicrous to dress her according to her
invalid mother&rsquo;s susceptibilities, the Squire was relieved
from the responsibility of deciding by Amabel&rsquo;s promptly
exposing her rosy cheeks to the breeze, and they drove on happily
to the town.&nbsp; The Squire had business with the Justices, and
Amabel was left at the Crown.&nbsp; When he came back, Amabel
jumped down from the window and the black blind over which she
was peeping into the yard, and ran up to her father with tears on
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, daddy!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;dear, good
daddy!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you to buy me a donkey, I want
you to buy me a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s modest!&rdquo; said the Squire; &ldquo;but
what are you crying for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s such a poor horse!&nbsp; Such a very
old, poor horse!&rdquo; cried Amabel.&nbsp; And from the window
Mr. Ammaby was able to confirm her statements.&nbsp; It was the
Cheap Jack&rsquo;s white horse, which he had been trying to
persuade the landlord to buy as a cab-horse.&nbsp; More lean,
more scarred, more drooping than ever, it was a pitiful sight,
now and then raising its soft nose and intelligent eyes to the
window, as if it knew what a benevolent little being was standing
on a slippery chair, with her arms round the Squire&rsquo;s neck,
pleading its cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when I buy horses,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;I
buy young, good ones, not very old and poor ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but do buy it, daddy!&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s not
had enough to eat, like that kitten I found in the ditch.&nbsp;
And perhaps it&rsquo;ll get fat, like her; and mamma said we
wanted an old horse to go in the cart for luggage, and I&rsquo;m
sure that one&rsquo;s very old.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s such a
horrid man, like hump-backed Richard.&nbsp; And when
nobody&rsquo;s looking, he tugs it, and beats it.&nbsp; Oh, I
wish I could beat him!&rdquo; and Amabel danced dangerously upon
the horsehair seat in her white gaiters with impotent
indignation.&nbsp; The Squire was very weak when pressed by his
daughter, but at horses, if at any thing, he looked with an eye
to business.&nbsp; To buy such a creature would be
ludicrous.&nbsp; Still, Amabel had made a strong point by what
Lady Louisa had said.&nbsp; No one, too, knew better than the
Squire what difference good and bad treatment can make in a
horse, and this one had been good once, as his experienced eye
told him.&nbsp; He said he &ldquo;would see,&rdquo; and strolled
into the yard.</p>
<p>Long practice had given the Cheap Jack a quickness in
detecting a possible purchaser which almost amounted to an extra
sense, and he at once began to assail the Squire.&nbsp; But a
nearer view of the white horse had roused Mr. Ammaby&rsquo;s
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re not
ashamed to exhibit a poor beast that&rsquo;s been so
ill-treated.&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake, take it to the
knacker&rsquo;s, and put it out of its misery at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look ye, my lord,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack, touching
his cap.&nbsp; &ldquo;The horse have been ill-treated, I
knows.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an afflicted man, my lord, and the boy
I&rsquo;ve employed, he&rsquo;s treated him shameful; and when a
man can&rsquo;t feed hisself, he can&rsquo;t keep his beast fat
neither.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I wants to get rid on him, my
lord.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t keep him as I should, and I&rsquo;d
like to see him with a gentleman like yourself as&rsquo;ll do him
justice.&nbsp; He comes of a good stock, my lord.&nbsp; Take him
for fifteen pound,&rdquo; he added, waddling up to the Squire,
&ldquo;and when you&rsquo;ve had him three months, you&rsquo;ll
sell him for thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much.&nbsp; The Squire broke out in a furious
rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You unblushing scoundrel!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;m a fool?&nbsp; Fifteen pounds
for a horse you should be fined for keeping alive!&nbsp; Be off
with it, and put it out of misery.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned
indignantly into the inn, the Cheap Jack calling after him,
&ldquo;Say ten pound, my lord!&rdquo; the bystanders giggling,
and the ostler whistling dryly through the straw in his mouth,
&ldquo;Take it to the knacker&rsquo;s, Cheap John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, daddy dear! have you got him?&rdquo; cried Amabel,
as the Squire re-entered the parlor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear; the poor beast isn&rsquo;t fit to draw
carts, my darling.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been so badly treated, the
only kindness now is to kill it, and put it out of pain.&nbsp;
And I&rsquo;ve told the hunchback so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a matter of course and humanity to the Squire, but it
overwhelmed poor Amabel.&nbsp; She gasped, &ldquo;Kill it!&rdquo;
and then bursting into a flood of tears she danced on the floor,
wringing her hands and crying, &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh! don&rsquo;t,
<i>please</i>, don&rsquo;t let him be killed!&nbsp; Oh! do, do
buy him and let him die comfortably in the paddock.&nbsp; Oh, do,
do, do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Amabel, you mustn&rsquo;t dance like
that.&nbsp; Remember, you promised to be good,&rdquo; said the
Squire.&nbsp; The child gulped down her tears, and stood quite
still, with her face pale from very misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want not to be good,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, oh dear, I do wish I had some money, that
I might buy that poor old horse, and let him die comfortably at
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not the money the Squire grudged; it was against all
his instincts to buy a bad horse.&nbsp; But Amabel&rsquo;s wan
face overcame him, and he went out again.&nbsp; He never lingered
over disagreeable business, and, going straight up to the Cheap
Jack, he said, &ldquo;My little girl is so distressed about it,
that I&rsquo;ll give you five pounds for the poor brute, to stop
its sufferings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say eight, my lord,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack.&nbsp;
Once more the Squire was turning away in wrath, when he caught
sight of Amabel&rsquo;s face at the window.&nbsp; He turned back,
and, biting his lip, said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you five pounds
if you&rsquo;ll take it now, and go.&nbsp; If you beat me down
again, I&rsquo;ll offer you four.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take off a
pound for every bate you utter; and, when I speak, I mean what I
say.&nbsp; Do you think I don&rsquo;t know one horse from
another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is probable that the Cheap Jack would have made another
effort to better his bargain, but his wife had come to seek him,
and to her sharp eyes the Squire&rsquo;s resolution was beyond
mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the five guineas, and thank you,
sir,&rdquo; she said, courtesying.&nbsp; The Squire did not care
to dispute the five shillings which she had dexterously added,
and he paid the sum, and the worthy couple went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miles!&rdquo; said the Squire.&nbsp; The servant he had
brought with him in reference to the donkey appeared, and touched
his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Amabel has persuaded me to buy this poor brute,
that it may die in peace in the paddock.&nbsp; Can you get it
home, d&rsquo;ye think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can, sir, this evening; after a feed and some
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white horse had suddenly become a centre of interest in
the inn-yard.&nbsp; Everybody, from the landlord to the
stable-boy, felt its legs, and patted it, and suggested various
lines of treatment.</p>
<p>Before he drove away, Mr. Ammaby overheard the landlord
saying, &ldquo;He be a sharp hand, is the Squire.&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he brought the beast round
yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which, for his credit&rsquo;s sake, the Squire
devoutly hoped he might.&nbsp; But, after all, he had his reward
when Amabel, sobbing with joy, flung her arms round him, and
cried,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dear, darling, <i>good</i> daddy!&nbsp; How I
love you and how the white horse loves you!&rdquo;</p>

161</span>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">MASTER SWIFT AT
HOME.&mdash;RUFUS.&mdash;THE EX-PIG-MINDER.&mdash;JAN AND THE
SCHOOLMASTER.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a lovely autumn evening the
same year, when the school having broken up for the day, Master
Swift returned to his home for tea.&nbsp; He lived in a tiny
cottage on the opposite side of the water-meadows to that on
which Dame Datchett dwelt, and farther down towards the
water-mill.&nbsp; He had neither wife nor child, but a red dog
with a plaintive face, and the name of Rufus, kept his house when
he was absent, and kept him company when he was at home.</p>
<p>Rufus was a mongrel.&nbsp; He was not a red setter, though his
coloring was similar.&nbsp; A politely disposed person would have
called him a retriever, and his curly back and general appearance
might have carried this off, but for his tail, which, instead of
being straight and rat-like, was as plumy as the Prince of
Wales&rsquo;s feathers, and curled unblushingly over his back,
sideways, like a pug&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a good one to
wag,&rdquo; his master said, and, apart from the question of high
breeding, it was handsome, and Rufus himself seemed proud of
it.</p>
<p>Since half-past three had Rufus sat in the porch, blinking
away positive sleep, with his pathetic face towards the road down
which Master Swift must come.&nbsp; Unnecessarily pathetic, for
there was every reason for his being the most jovial of dogs, and
not one for that imposing melancholy which he wore.&nbsp; His
large level eyelids shaded the pupils even when he was broad
awake; an intellectual forehead, and a very long Vandykish nose,
with the curly ears, which fell like a well-dressed peruke on
each side of his face, gave him an air of disinherited
royalty.&nbsp; But he was in truth a mongrel, living on the fat
of the land; who, from the day that this wistful dignity had won
the schoolmaster&rsquo;s heart, had never known a care, wanted a
meal, or had any thing whatever demanded of him but to sit
comfortably at home and watch with a broken-hearted countenance
for the schoolmaster&rsquo;s return from the labors which
supported them both.&nbsp; The sunshine made Rufus sleepy, but he
kept valiantly watchful, propping himself against the
garden-tools which stood in the corner.&nbsp; Flowers and
vegetables for eating were curiously mixed in the little garden
that lay about Master Swift&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp; Not a corner
was wasted in it, and a thick hedge of sweet-peas formed a
fragrant fence from the outer world.</p>
<p>Rufus was nodding, when he heard a footstep.&nbsp; He pulled
himself up, but he did not wag his tail, for the step was not the
schoolmaster&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was Jan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Rufus
growled slightly, and Jan stood outside, and called,
&ldquo;Master Swift!&rdquo;&nbsp; He and Rufus both paused and
listened, but the schoolmaster did not appear.&nbsp; Then Rufus
came out and smelt Jan exhaustively, and excepting a slight
flavor of being acquainted with cats, to whom Rufus objected, he
smelt well.&nbsp; Rufus wagged his tail, Jan patted him, and they
sat down to wait for the master.</p>
<p>The clock in the old square-towered church had struck a
quarter-past four when Master Swift came down the lane, and Rufus
rushed out to meet him.&nbsp; Though Rufus told him in so many
barks that there was a stranger within, and that, as he smelt
respectable, he had allowed him to wait, the schoolmaster was
startled by the sight of Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s the little pig-minder!&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; On which Jan&rsquo;s face crimsoned, and tears welled
up in his black eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bean&rsquo;t a pig-minder now, Master Swift,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s that?&nbsp; Has Master Salter turned ye
off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gi&rsquo;ed <i>him</i> notice!&rdquo; said Jan,
indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I shan&rsquo;t mind pigs no more,
Master Swift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, Master Skymaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee laugh, sir,&rdquo; said
Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Master Salter he laughs.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s pigs for but to be killed?&rsquo; says
he.&nbsp; But I axed him not to kill the little black un with the
white spot on his ear.&nbsp; It be such a nice pig, sir, such a
very nice pig!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the tears flowed copiously down
Jan&rsquo;s cheeks, whilst Rufus looked abjectly depressed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would follow me anywhere, and come when I
called,&rdquo; Jan continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told Master Salter
it be &rsquo;most as good as a dog, to keep the rest
together.&nbsp; But a says &rsquo;tis the fattest, and &rsquo;ull
be the first to kill.&nbsp; And then I telled him to find another
boy to mind his pigs, for I couldn&rsquo;t look un in the face
now, and know &rsquo;twas to be killed next month, not that one
with the white spot on his ear.&nbsp; It do be such a <i>very</i>
nice pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rufus licked up the tears as they fell over Jan&rsquo;s smock,
and the schoolmaster took Jan in and comforted him.&nbsp; Jan
dried his eyes at last, and helped to prepare for tea.&nbsp; The
old man made some very good coffee in a shaving-pot, and put cold
bacon and bread upon the table, and the three sat down to their
meal.&nbsp; Jan and his host upon two rush-bottomed chairs,
whilst Rufus scrambled into an armchair placed for his
accommodation, from whence he gazed alternately at the
schoolmaster and the victuals with sad, not to say reproachful,
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that would be your chair,&rdquo; said
Jan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p164b.jpg">
<img alt=
"&ldquo;I thought that would be your chair...&rdquo;"
title=
"&ldquo;I thought that would be your chair...&rdquo;"
 src="images/p164s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it used to be,&rdquo; said Master Swift,
apologetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the poor beast can&rsquo;t sit
well on these, and I relish my meat better with a face on the
other side of the table.&nbsp; He found that too slippery at
first, till I bought yon bit of a patchwork-cushion for him at a
sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rufus sighed, and Master Swift gave him a piece of bread,
which, having smelt, he allowed to lie before him on the table
till his master, laughing, rubbed the bread against the bacon,
with which additional flavor Rufus seemed content, and ate his
supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come to the old schoolmaster, after
all?&rdquo; said Master Swift: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right, my lad,
that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Abel sent me,&rdquo; said Jan; &ldquo;he
said I was to take to my books.&nbsp; So I come because Abel axed
me.&nbsp; For I be main fond of Abel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abel was right,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take to learning, my lad.&nbsp; Love your
books,&mdash;friends that nobody can kill, or part ye
from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to learn pieces like them you
say,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ye shall, so ye shall!&rdquo; cried Master
Swift.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine thing, is learning
poetry.&nbsp; It strengthens the memory, and cultivates the
higher faculties.&nbsp; Take some more bacon, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which Jan did.&nbsp; At that moment he was not reflecting on
his doomed friend, the spotted pig.&nbsp; Indeed, if we reflected
about every thing, this present state of existence would become
intolerable.</p>
<p>At much length did the schoolmaster speak on the joys of
learning, and, pointing proudly to a few shelves filled by his
savings, he formally made Jan &ldquo;free of&rdquo; his
books.&nbsp; &ldquo;When ye&rsquo;ve learnt to read them,&rdquo;
he added.&nbsp; Jan thanked him for this, and for leave to visit
him.&nbsp; But he looked out of the window instead of at the
book-shelves.</p>
<p>Beyond Master Swift&rsquo;s gay flowers stretched the rich
green of the water-meads, glowing yellow in the sunlight.&nbsp;
The little river hardly seemed to move in its zig-zag path,
though the evening breeze was strong enough to show the silver
side of the willows that drooped over it.&nbsp; Jan wondered if
he could match all these tints in the wood, and whether Master
Swift would be willing to have leaf-pictures painted on that
table in the window.&nbsp; Then he found that the old man was
speaking, though he only heard the latter part of what he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;&mdash;a celebrated inventor and mechanic, and
that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll be, maybe.&nbsp; Ay, ay, a Great
Man, please the Lord; and, when I&rsquo;m laid by in the
churchyard yonder, folks&rsquo;ll come to see the grave of old
Swift, the great man&rsquo;s schoolmaster.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll be
an inventor yet, lad, a benefactor to your kind, and an honor to
your country.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not raising false hopes in ye,
without observing your qualities.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve the quick
eye, the slow patience, and the inventive spark.&nbsp; You can
find your own tools and all, and don&rsquo;t stop where other
folk leaves off: witness yon bluebells ye took to make skies
with!&nbsp; But, bless the lad, he&rsquo;s not heeding me!&nbsp;
Is it the bit of garden you&rsquo;re looking at?&nbsp; Come out
then.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, putting the biography back in the
book-shelf, the kindly old man led Jan out of doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say what you said in the wood again,&rdquo; said
Jan.</p>
<p>But Master Swift laughed, and, stretching his hand towards the
sweet-peas hedge began at another part of the poem:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here are sweet peas on tiptoe for a
flight:<br />
With wings of gentle flush o&rsquo;er delicate white,<br />
And taper fingers catching at all things<br />
To bind them all about with tiny rings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, bending towards the river, he continued in a theatrical
whisper:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How silent comes the water round that
bend!<br />
Not the minutest whisper does it send<br />
To the o&rsquo;erhanging sallows&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But here he stopped suddenly, though Jan&rsquo;s black eyes
were at their roundest, and his attention almost breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an old fool, and for
making you as bad.&nbsp; Poetry&rsquo;s not your business, you
understand: I&rsquo;m giving ye no encouragement to dabble with
the fine arts.&nbsp; Science is the ladder for a working-man to
climb to fame.&nbsp; In addition to which, the poet Keats, though
he certainly speaks the very language of Nature, was a bit of a
heathen, I&rsquo;m afraid, and the fascination of him might be
injurious in tender youth.&nbsp; Never mind, child, if ye love
poetry, I&rsquo;ll learn ye pieces by the poet Herbert.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re just true poetry, and manly, too; and they&rsquo;re
a fountain of experimental religion.&nbsp; And, if this style is
too sober for your fancy, Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns are
touched with the very fire of religious passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are your folk religious, Jan?&rdquo; he added,
abruptly.&nbsp; And whilst Jan stood puzzling the question, he
asked with an almost official air of authority, &ldquo;Do ye any
of ye come to church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father does on club-days,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the rest of ye,&mdash;do ye attend any place of
worship?&rdquo; Jan shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll dare to say ye didn&rsquo;t know I was
the clerk?&rdquo; said Master Swift.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
paganism for ye in a Christian parish!&nbsp; Well, well,
you&rsquo;re coming to me, lad, and, apart from your secular
studies, you&rsquo;ll be instructed in the Word of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and in the Church Catechism on
Fridays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.&nbsp; He felt this
civility to be due, though of the schoolmaster&rsquo;s plans for
his benefit he had a very confused notion.&nbsp; He then took
leave.&nbsp; Rufus went with him to the gate, and returned to his
master with a look which plainly said, &ldquo;We could have done
with him very well, if you had kept him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jan had reached a bit of rising ground, from which the
house he had just left was visible, he turned round to look at it
again.</p>
<p>Master Swift was standing where he had left him, gazing out
into the distance with painful intensity.&nbsp; The fast-sinking
sun lit up his heavy face and figure with a transforming glow,
and hung a golden mist above the meads, at which he stared like
one spellbound.&nbsp; But when Jan turned to pursue his way to
the windmill, the schoolmaster turned also, and went back into
the cottage.</p>

168</span>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE PARISH
CHURCH.&mdash;REMBRANDT.&mdash;THE SNOW SCENE.&mdash;MASTER
SWIFT&rsquo;S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> most respects, Jan&rsquo;s
conduct and progress were very satisfactory.&nbsp; He quickly
learned to read, and his copy-books were models.</p>
<p>The good clerk developed another talent in him.&nbsp; Jan
learned to sing, and to sing very well; and he was put into the
choir-seats in the old church, where he sang with enthusiasm
hymns which he had learned by heart from the schoolmaster.</p>
<p>No wild weather that ever blustered over the downs could keep
Jan now from the services.&nbsp; The old church came to have a
fascination for him, from the low, square tower without, round
which the rooks wheeled, to the springing pillars, the solemn
gray tints of the stone, and the round arches that so gratified
the eye within.&nbsp; And did he not sit opposite to the one
stained window the soldiers of the Commonwealth had spared to the
parish!&nbsp; It was the only colored picture Jan knew, and he
knew every line, every tint of it, and the separate expression on
each of the wan, quaint faces of the figures.&nbsp; When the sun
shone, they seemed to smile at him, and their ruby dresses glowed
like garments dyed in blood.&nbsp; When the colors fell upon
Abel&rsquo;s white head, Jan wished with all his heart that he
could have gathered them as he gathered leaves, to make pictures
with.&nbsp; Sometimes he day-dreamed that one of the figures came
down out of the window, and brought the colors with him, and that
he and Jan painted pictures in the other windows, filling them
with gorgeous hues, and pale, devout faces.&nbsp; The fancy,
empty as it was, pleased him, and he planned how every window
should be done, and told Abel, to whom the ingenious fancy seemed
as marvellous as if the work had been accomplished.</p>
<p>Abel was in the choir too, not so much because of his voice as
of his great wish for it, and of the example of his good
behavior.&nbsp; It was he who persuaded Mrs. Lake to come to
church, and having once begun she came often.&nbsp; She tried to
persuade her husband to go, and told him how sweetly the
boys&rsquo; voices sounded, led by Master Swift&rsquo;s fine
bass, which he pitched from a key which he knocked upon his
desk.&nbsp; But Master Lake had a proverb to excuse him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The nearer the church, the further from <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not that he pretended to
maintain the converse of the proposition.</p>
<p>Jan learned plenty of poetry; hymns, which Abel learned again
from him, some of Herbert&rsquo;s poems, and bits of Keats.&nbsp;
But his favorites were martial poems by Mrs. Hemans, which he
found in an old volume of collected verses, till the day he came
upon &ldquo;Marmion,&rdquo; and gave himself up to Sir Walter
Scott.&nbsp; He spouted poetry to Abel in imitation of Master
Swift, and they enjoyed all, and understood about half.</p>
<p>And yet Jan&rsquo;s progress was not altogether satisfactory
to his teacher.</p>
<p>To learn long pieces of poetry was easy pastime to him, but he
was dull or inattentive when the schoolmaster gave him some
elementary lessons in mechanics.&nbsp; He wrote beautifully, but
was no prodigy in arithmetic.&nbsp; He drew trees, windmills, and
pigs on the desks, and admirable portraits of the schoolmaster,
Rufus, and other local worthies, on the margins of the tables of
weights and measures.</p>
<p>Much of his leisure was spent at Master Swift&rsquo;s cottage,
and in reading his books.&nbsp; The schoolmaster had marked an
old biographical dictionary at pages containing lives of
&ldquo;self-made&rdquo; men, who had risen as inventors or
improvers in mechanics or as discoverers of important facts of
natural science.&nbsp; Jan had not hitherto studied their careers
with the avidity Master Swift would have liked to see, but one
day he found him reading the fat volume with deep interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whose life are ye at now, laddie?&rdquo; he asked,
with a smile.</p>
<p>Jan lifted his face, which was glowing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Rembrandt the painter I be reading about.&nbsp;
Eh, Master Swift, he lived in a windmill, and he was a
miller&rsquo;s son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;d a miller&rsquo;s thumb,&rdquo; Jan
added, stretching out his own, and smiling at the droll
idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do &rsquo;ee know what <i>etchings</i> be,
then, Master Swift?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kind of picture that&rsquo;s scratched on a piece of
copper with needles, and costs a lot of money to print,&rdquo;
said Master Swift, dryly; and he turned his broad back and went
out.</p>
<p>It was one day in the second winter of Jan&rsquo;s learning
under Master Swift that matters came to a climax.&nbsp; The
schoolmaster loved punctuality, but Jan was not always
punctual.&nbsp; He was generally better in this respect in winter
than in summer, as there was less to distract his attention on
the road to school.&nbsp; But one winter&rsquo;s day he loitered
to make a sketch on his slate, and made matters worse by putting
finishing touches to it after he was seated at the desk.</p>
<p>It was not a day to suggest sketching, but, turning round when
he was about half way to the village, the view seemed to Jan to
be exactly suitable for a slate sketch.&nbsp; The long slopes of
the downs were white with snow; but it was a dull grayish white,
for there was no sunshine, and the gray-white of the slate-pencil
did it justice enough.&nbsp; In the middle distance rose the
windmill, and a thatched cattle shed and some palings made an
admirable foreground.&nbsp; On the top and edges of these lay the
snow, outlining them in white, which again the slate-pencil could
imitate effectively.&nbsp; There only wanted something darker
than the slate itself to do those parts of the foreground and the
mill which looked darker than the sky, and for this Jan trusted
to pen and ink when he reached his desk.&nbsp; The drawing was
very successful, and Jan was so absorbed in admiring it that he
did not notice the schoolmaster&rsquo;s approach, but feeling
some one behind him, he fancied it was one of the boys, and held
up the slate triumphantly, whispering, &ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Master Swift who looked, and snatching the slate he
brought it down on the sharp corner of the desk, and broke it to
pieces.&nbsp; Then he went back to his place, and spoke neither
bad nor good to Jan for the rest of the school-time.&nbsp; Jan
would much rather have been beaten.&nbsp; Once or twice he made
essay to go up to Master Swift&rsquo;s desk, but the old
man&rsquo;s stern countenance discouraged him, and he finally
shrank into a corner and sat weeping bitterly.&nbsp; He sat there
till every scholar but himself had gone, and still the
schoolmaster did not speak.&nbsp; Jan slunk out, and when Master
Swift turned homewards Jan followed silently in his footsteps
through the snow.&nbsp; At the door of the cottage, the old man
looked round with a relenting face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Rufus&rsquo;ll insist on your coming
in,&rdquo; said he; and Jan rushing in hid his face in
Rufus&rsquo;s curls, and sobbed heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; said the schoolmaster.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
more of that, child.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s bitters enough in life,
without being so prodigal of your tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and sit down with ye,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very young, lad, and maybe I&rsquo;m foolish
to be angry with ye that you&rsquo;re not wise.&nbsp; But yet
ye&rsquo;ve more sense than your years in some respects, and
I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll try and make ye see things as I see
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to tell ye something about
myself, if ye&rsquo;d care to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be main pleased, Master Swift,&rdquo; said
Jan, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d none of your advantages, lad,&rdquo; said the
old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I was your age, I knew more mischief
than you need ever know, and uncommon little else.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m a self-educated man,&mdash;I used to hope I should live
to hear folk say a self-made Great Man.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bitter
thing to have the ambition without the genius, to smoulder in the
fire that great men shine by!&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s something
to have just the saving sense to know that ye&rsquo;ve not got
it, though it&rsquo;s taken a wasted lifetime to convince me, and
I sometimes think the deceiving serpent is more scotched than
killed yet.&nbsp; However, ye seem to me to be likelier to lack
the ambition than the genius, so we may let that bide.&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s a snare of mine, Jan, that I mean your feet to be
free of, and that&rsquo;s a mischosen vocation.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not a native of these parts, ye must know.&nbsp; I come from the
north, and in those mining and manufacturing districts I&rsquo;ve
seen many a man that&rsquo;s got an education, and could keep
himself sober, rise to own his house and his works, and have men
under him, and bring up his children like the gentry.&nbsp; For
mark ye, my lad.&nbsp; In such matters the experiences of the
early part of an artisan&rsquo;s life are all so much to the good
for him, for they&rsquo;re in the working of the trade, and the
finest young gentleman has got it all to learn, if he wants to
make money in that line.&nbsp; I got my education, and I was
sober enough, but&mdash;Heaven help me&mdash;I must be a poet,
and in <i>that</i> line a gentleman&rsquo;s son knows almost from
the nursery many a thing that I had to teach myself with hard
labor as a man.&nbsp; It was just a madness.&nbsp; But I read all
the poetry I could lay my hands on, and I wrote as
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you write poetry, Master Swift?&rdquo; said
Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Jan, of a sort.&nbsp; At one time I worshipped
Burns.&nbsp; And then I wrote verses in the dialect of my native
place, which, ye must know, I can speak with any man when
I&rsquo;ve a mind,&rdquo; said Master Swift, unconscious that he
spoke it always.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then it was Wordsworth, for the
love of nature is just a passion with me, and it&rsquo;s that
that made the poet Keats a new world to me.&nbsp; Well, well, now
I&rsquo;m telling you how I came here.&nbsp; It was after my
wife.&nbsp; She was lady&rsquo;s-maid to Squire Ammaby&rsquo;s
mother, and the old Squire got me the school.&nbsp; Ah, those
were happy days!&nbsp; I was a godless, rough sort of a fellow
when she married me, but I became a converted man.&nbsp; And let
me tell ye, lad, when a man and wife love <span
class="smcap">God</span> and each other, and live in the country,
a bit of ground like this becomes a very garden of
Eden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your wife like your poetry, sir?&rdquo; said Jan,
on whom the idea that the schoolmaster was a poet made a strong
impression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Jan.&nbsp; She was a good scholar.&nbsp; I
wrote a bit about that time called Love and Ambition, in the
style of the poet Wordsworth.&nbsp; It was as much as to say that
Love had killed Ambition, ye understand?&nbsp; But it
wasn&rsquo;t dead.&nbsp; It had only shifted to another
object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a child.&nbsp; I remember the first day his blue
eyes looked at me with what I may call sense in &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
He was in his cradle, and there was no one but me with him.&nbsp;
I went on like a fool.&nbsp; &lsquo;See thee, my son,&rsquo; I
said, &lsquo;thy father&rsquo;s been a bad &rsquo;un, but
he&rsquo;ll keep thee as pure as thy mother.&nbsp; Thy
father&rsquo;s a poor scholar, but he&rsquo;s not <i>that</i>
dull but what he&rsquo;ll make <i>thee</i> as learned as the
parson.&nbsp; Thy father&rsquo;s a needy man, a man in a small
way, but he and thy mother&rsquo;ll stick here in this dull bit
of a village, content, ay, my lad, right happy, so thou&rsquo;rt
a rich man, and can see the world!&rsquo;&nbsp; I give ye my
word, Jan, the child looked at me as if he understood it
all.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re wondering, maybe, what made me hope
he&rsquo;d do different to what I&rsquo;d done.&nbsp; But, ye
see, his mother was just an angel, and I reckoned he&rsquo;d be
half like her.&nbsp; Then she&rsquo;d lived with gentlefolks from
a child, and knew manners and such like that I never
learned.&nbsp; And for as little as I&rsquo;d taught myself,
he&rsquo;d at any rate begin where his father left off.&nbsp; He
was all we had.&nbsp; There seemed no fault in him.&nbsp; His
mother dressed him like a little prince, and his manners were the
same.&nbsp; Ah, we <i>were</i> happy!&nbsp;
Then&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Master Swift?&rdquo; said Jan, for the
schoolmaster had paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t ye see the place is empty?&rdquo; he
answered sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who takes bite or sup with me but
Rufus?&nbsp; <i>She died</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have gone mad but for the boy.&nbsp; All my
thought was to make up her loss to him.&nbsp; A child learns a
man to be unselfish, Jan.&nbsp; I used to think, &lsquo;<span
class="smcap">God</span> may well be the very fount of unselfish
charity, when He has so many children, so helpless without
Him!&rsquo;&nbsp; I think He taught me how to do for that
boy.&nbsp; I dressed him, I darned his socks: what work I
couldn&rsquo;t do I put out, but I had no one in.&nbsp; When I
came in from school, I cleaned myself, and changed my boots, to
give him his meals.&nbsp; Rufus and I eat off the table now, but
I give ye my word when he was alive we&rsquo;d three clean cloths
a week, and he&rsquo;d a pinny every day; and there&rsquo;s a
silver fork and spoon in yon drawer I saved up to buy him, and
had his name put on.&nbsp; I taught him too.&nbsp; He loved
poetry as well as his father.&nbsp; He could say most of
Milton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lycidas.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was an unlucky
thing to have learned him too!&nbsp; Eh, Jan! we&rsquo;re poor
fools.&nbsp; I lay awake night after night reconciling my mind to
troubles that were never to come, and never dreaming of what
<i>was</i> before me.&nbsp; I thought to myself, &lsquo;John
Swift, my lad, you&rsquo;re making yourself a bed of
thorns.&nbsp; As sure as you make your son a gentleman, so sure
he&rsquo;ll look down on his old father when he gets up.&nbsp;
Can ye bear that, John Swift, and <i>her</i> dead, and him all
that ye have?&rsquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t ask myself twice,
Jan.&nbsp; Of course I could bear it.&nbsp; Would any parent stop
his child from being better than himself because he&rsquo;d be
looked down on?&nbsp; I never heard of one.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want
him to think me rough and ignorant,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;for I
want him to know what&rsquo;s better.&nbsp; And I shan&rsquo;t
expect him to think on how I&rsquo;ve slaved for him, till
he&rsquo;s children of his own, and their mother a lady.&nbsp;
But when I&rsquo;m dead,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;and he stands by
my grave, and I can&rsquo;t shame him no more with my common
ways, he&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;The old man did his best for
me,&rdquo; for he has his mother&rsquo;s feelings.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
tell ye, Jan, I cried like a child to think of him standing at my
burying in a good black coat and a silk scarf like a gentleman,
and I no more thought of standing at his than if he was bound to
live for ever.&nbsp; And, mind ye, I did all I could to improve
myself.&nbsp; I learned while I was teaching, and read all I
could lay my hands on.&nbsp; Books of travels made me wild.&nbsp;
I was young still, and I&rsquo;d have given a deal to see the
world.&nbsp; But I was saving every penny for him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll see it all,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and
that&rsquo;s enough,&mdash;Italy and Greece, and Egypt, and the
Holy Land.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;ll see the sea (which I never saw
but once, and that was at Cleethorpes), and he&rsquo;ll go to the
tropics, and see flowers that &rsquo;ud just turn his old
father&rsquo;s head, and he&rsquo;ll write and tell me of
&rsquo;em, for he&rsquo;s got his mother&rsquo;s feelings.&rsquo;
. . .&nbsp; My <span class="smcap">God</span>!&nbsp; He never
passed the parish bounds, and he&rsquo;s lain alongside of her in
yon churchyard for five and thirty years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Swift&rsquo;s head sank upon his breast, and he was
silent, as if in a trance, but Jan dared not speak.&nbsp; The
silence was broken by Rufus, who got up and stuffed his nose into
the schoolmaster&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor lad!&rdquo; said his master, patting him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;rt a good soul, too!&nbsp; Well, Jan, I&rsquo;m
here, ye see.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t kill me.&nbsp; I was off my
head a bit, I believe, but they kept the school for me, and I got
to work again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m rough pottery, lad, and take a
deal of breaking.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve took up with dumb animals,
too, a good deal.&nbsp; At least, they&rsquo;ve took up with
me.&nbsp; Most of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s come, like Rufus, of
themselves.&nbsp; Mangy puppies no one would own, cats with
kettles to their tails, and so on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always had a
bit of company to my meals, and that&rsquo;s the main
thing.&nbsp; Folks has said to me, &lsquo;Master Swift, I
don&rsquo;t know how you can keep on schooling.&nbsp; I reckon
you can hardly abide the sight of boys now you&rsquo;ve lost your
own.&rsquo;&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re wrong, Jan: it seemed to give
me a kind of love for every lad I lit upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye thinking ambition was dead in the old man at
last?&nbsp; It came to life again, Jan.&nbsp; After a bit, I says
to myself, &lsquo;In a dull place like this there&rsquo;s
doubtless many a boy that might rise that never has the chance
that I&rsquo;d have given to mine.&nbsp; For what says the poet
Gray?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But Knowledge to their eyes her ample
page,<br />
Rich with the spoils of Time, did ne&rsquo;er
unroll.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Jan, sometimes, I&rsquo;m like Rachel,
who&rsquo;d rather have taken to her servant&rsquo;s children
than have had none.&nbsp; I thought, &lsquo;If there&rsquo;s a
genius in obscurity here, I&rsquo;ll come across the boy, being
schoolmaster, and I&rsquo;ll do for him as I&rsquo;d have done
for my own.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jan, I&rsquo;ve seen nigh on seven
generations of lads pass through this school, but <i>he&rsquo;s
never come</i>!&nbsp; Society&rsquo;s quit of that blame.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s been no &rsquo;mute, inglorious Miltons&rsquo; here
since I come to this place.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s been many a
nice-tempered lad I&rsquo;ve loved, for I&rsquo;m fond of
children, but never one that yearned to see places he&rsquo;d
never seen, or to know things he&rsquo;d never heard of.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no fool like an old one, and I think I&rsquo;ve
been more disappointed as time went on.&nbsp; I submitted myself
to the Lord&rsquo;s will years ago; but I <i>have</i> prayed Him,
on my knees, since He didn&rsquo;t see fit to raise me and mine,
to let me have that satisfaction to help some other man&rsquo;s
son to knowledge and to fame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan Lake,&rdquo; said Master Swift, &ldquo;when I found
you in yon wood, I found what I&rsquo;ve looked for in vain for
thirty-five years.&nbsp; Have I been schoolmaster so long,
d&rsquo;ye think, and don&rsquo;t know one boy&rsquo;s face from
another?&nbsp; Lad? is it possible ye don&rsquo;t <i>care</i> to
be a great man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan cared very much, but he was afraid of Master Swift; and it
was by an effort that he summoned up courage to say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I be a great painter, Master Swift,
don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man frowned impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have I been
telling ye?&nbsp; The Fine Arts are not the road to fame for
working-men.&nbsp; Jan, Jan, be guided by me.&nbsp; Learn what I
bid ye.&nbsp; And when ye&rsquo;ve made name and fortune the way
I show ye, ye can buy paints and paintings at your will, and
paint away to please your leisure hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not need the gentle Abel&rsquo;s after-counsel to
persuade Jan to submit himself to the schoolmaster&rsquo;s
direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do as ye bid me, Master Swift; indeed, I
will, sir,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>But, when the pleased old man rambled on of fame and fortune,
it must be confessed that Jan but thought of them as the steps to
those hours of wealthy leisure in which he could buy paints and
indulge the irrepressible bent of his genius without blame.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE WHITE HORSE IN
CLOVER.&mdash;AMABEL AND HER GUARDIANS.&mdash;AMABEL IN THE
WOOD.&mdash;BOGY.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> white horse lived to see good
days.&nbsp; He got safely home, and spent the winter in a
comfortable stable, with no work but being exercised for the good
of his health by the stable-boy.&nbsp; It was expensive, but
expense was not a first consideration with the Squire, and when
he had once decided a matter, he was not apt to worry himself
with regrets.&nbsp; As to Amabel the very narrowness of the white
horse&rsquo;s escape from death exalted him at once to the place
of first favorite in her tender heart, even over the head (and
ears) of the new donkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Amabel&rsquo;s&rdquo; interest in the cart-horse
offended her nurse&rsquo;s ideas of propriety, and met with no
sympathy from her mother or grandmother.&nbsp; But she was apt to
get her own way; and from time to time she appeared suddenly,
like a fairy-imp, in the stable, where she majestically directed
the groom to hold her up whilst she plied a currycomb on the old
horse&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; This over, she would ask with dignity,
&ldquo;Do you take care of him, Miles?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Miles,
touching his cap, would reply, &ldquo;Certainly, miss, the very
greatest of care.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Amabel would add, &ldquo;Does
he get plenty to eat, do you think?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Plenties
to heat, miss,&rdquo; the groom would reply.&nbsp; And she
generally closed the conversation with, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very
glad.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a good man, Miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spring the white horse was turned out into the paddock,
where Amabel had begged that he might die comfortably.&nbsp; He
lived comfortably instead; and Amabel visited him constantly, and
being perfectly fearless would kiss his white nose as he drooped
it into her little arms.&nbsp; Her visits to the stable had been
discovered and forbidden, but the scandal was even greater when
she was found in the paddock, standing on an inverted bucket, and
grooming the white horse with Lady Louisa&rsquo;s tortoise-shell
dressing-comb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let me have the currycomb,&rdquo;
said Amabel, who was very hot, and perfectly
self-satisfied.&nbsp; Lady Louisa was in despair, but the Squire
laughed.&nbsp; The ladies of his family had been great horsewomen
for generations.</p>
<p>In the early summer, some light carting being required by the
gardener, he begged leave to employ &ldquo;Miss Amabel&rsquo;s
old horse,&rdquo; who came at last to trot soberly to the town
with a light cart for parcels, when the landlord of the Crown
would point him out in proof of the Squire&rsquo;s sagacity in
horse-flesh.</p>
<p>But it was not by her attachment to the cart-horse alone that
Amabel disturbed the composure of the head-nurse and of Louise
the <i>bonne</i>.&nbsp; She was a very Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp for
wandering.&nbsp; She grew rapidly, and the stronger she grew the
more of a Tom-boy she became.&nbsp; Beyond the paddock lay
another field, whose farthest wall was the boundary of a little
wood,&mdash;the wood where Jan had herded pigs.&nbsp; Into this
wood it had long been Amabel&rsquo;s desire to go.&nbsp; But
nurses have a preference for the high road, and object to
climbing walls, and she had not had her wish.&nbsp; She had often
peeped through a hole in the wall, and had smelt
honeysuckle.&nbsp; Once she had climbed half way up, and had
fallen on her back in the ditch.&nbsp; Louise uttered a thousand
and one exclamations when Amabel came home after this
catastrophe; and Nurse, distrusting the success of any real
penalties in her power, fell back upon imaginary ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a mercy you have got back,
Miss Amabel,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;for Bogy lives in that wood;
and, if you&rsquo;d got in, it&rsquo;s ten to one he&rsquo;d have
carried you off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>said</i> Bogy lived in the cellar,&rdquo; said
Amabel.</p>
<p>Nurse was in a dilemma which deservedly besets people who tell
untruths.&nbsp; She had to invent a second one to help out her
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s at night,&rdquo; said she: &ldquo;he lives
in the wood in the daytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can go into the cellar in the day, and the wood
at night,&rdquo; retorted Amabel; but in her heart she knew the
latter was impossible.</p>
<p>For some days Nurse&rsquo;s fable availed.&nbsp; Amabel had
suffered a good deal from Bogy; and, though the fear of him did
not seem so terrible by daylight, she had no wish to meet
him.&nbsp; But one lovely afternoon, wandering round the field
for cowslips, Amabel came to the wall, and could not but peep
over to see if there were any flowers to be seen.&nbsp; She was
too short to do this without climbing, and it ended in her
struggling successfully to the top.&nbsp; There were violets on
the other side, and Amabel let down one big foot to a convenient
hole, whence she hoped to be able to stoop and catch at the
violets without actually treading in Bogy&rsquo;s domain.&nbsp;
But once more she slipped and rolled over,&mdash;this time into
the wood.&nbsp; Bogy lingered, and she got on to her feet; but
the wall was deeper on this side than the other, and she saw with
dismay that it was very doubtful if she could get back.</p>
<p>I think, as a rule, children are very brave.&nbsp; But a light
heart goes a long way towards courage.&nbsp; At first Amabel made
desperate and knee-grazing efforts to reclimb the wall, and,
failing, burst into tears, and danced, and called aloud on all
her protectors, from the Squire to Miles.&nbsp; No one coming,
she restrained her tears, and by a real effort of that
&ldquo;pluck&rdquo; for which the Ammaby race is famous began to
run along the wall to find a lower point for climbing.&nbsp; In
doing so, she startled a squirrel, and whizz!&mdash;away he went
up a lanky tree.&nbsp; What a tail he had!&nbsp; Amabel forgot
her terrors.&nbsp; There was at any rate some living thing in the
wood besides Bogy; and she was now busy trying to coax the
squirrel down again by such encouraging noises as she had found
successful in winning the confidence of kittens and
puppies.&nbsp; Amabel was the victim of that weakness for falling
in love with every fussy, intelligent, or pitiable beast she met
with, which besets some otherwise reasonable beings, leading to
an inconvenient accumulation of pets in private life, though
doubtless invaluable in the public services of people connected
with the Zo&ouml;logical Gardens.</p>
<p>The squirrel sat under the shadow of his own tail, and
winked.&nbsp; He had not the remotest intention of coming
down.&nbsp; Amabel was calmer now, and she looked about
her.&nbsp; The eglantine bushes were shoulder-high, but she had
breasted underwood in the shrubberies, and was not afraid.&nbsp;
Up, up, stretched the trees to where the sky shone blue.&nbsp;
The wood itself sloped downwards; the spotted arums pushed boldly
through last year&rsquo;s leaves, which almost hid the violets;
there were tufts of primroses, which made Amabel cry out, and
about them lay the exquisite mauve dog-violets in unplucked
profusion.&nbsp; And hither and thither darted the little birds;
red-breasts and sparrows, and yellow finches and blue finches,
and blackbirds and thrushes, with their cheerful voices and soft
waistcoats, and, indeed, every good quality but that of knowing
how glad one would be to kiss them.&nbsp; In a few steps, Amabel
came upon a path going zig-zag down the steep of the wood, and,
nodding her hooded head determinedly, she said, &ldquo;Amabel is
going a walk.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind Bogy,&rdquo; and followed
her nose.</p>
<p>It is a pity that one&rsquo;s skirt, when held up, does not
divide itself into compartments, like some vegetable
dishes.&nbsp; One is so apt to get flowers first, and then lumps
of moss, which spoil the flowers, and then more moss, which,
earth downwards (as bread and butter falls), does no good to the
rest.&nbsp; Amabel had on a nice, new dress, and it held things
beautifully.&nbsp; But it did not hold enough, for at each step
of the zig-zag path the moss grew lovelier.&nbsp; She had got
some extinguisher-moss from the top of the wall, and this now lay
under all the rest, which flattened the extinguishers.&nbsp;
About half way down the dress was full, and some cushion-moss
appeared that could not be passed by.&nbsp; Amabel sat down and
reviewed her treasures.&nbsp; She could part with nothing, and
she had just caught sight of some cup-moss lichen for
dolls&rsquo; wine-glasses.&nbsp; But, by good luck, she was
provided with a white sun-bonnet, as clean and whole as her
dress; and this she took off and filled.&nbsp; It was less
fortunate that the scale-mosses and liverworts, growing nearer to
the stream, came last, and, with the damp earth about them, lay
a-top of every thing, flowers, dolls&rsquo; wine-glasses, and
all.&nbsp; It was a noble collection&mdash;but heavy.&nbsp;
Amabel&rsquo;s face flushed, and she was slightly overbalanced,
but she staggered sturdily along the path, which was now
level.</p>
<p>She had quite forgotten Nurse&rsquo;s warning, when she came
suddenly upon a figure crouched in her path, and gazing at her
with large, black eyes.&nbsp; Her fat cheeks turned pale, and
with a cry of, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bogy!&rdquo; she let down the
whole contents of her dress into one of Jan&rsquo;s
leaf-pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt me!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t take me
away!&nbsp; Please, please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried, dancing
wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt you, Miss.&nbsp; I be going to help
you to pick &rsquo;em up,&rdquo; said Jan.&nbsp; By the time he
had returned her treasures to her skirt, Amabel had regained
confidence, especially as she saw no signs of the black bag in
which naughty children are supposed to be put.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, Bogy?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p184b.jpg">
<img alt=
"&ldquo;What are you doing, Bogy?&rdquo; said she"

"&ldquo;What are you doing, Bogy?&rdquo; said she"

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I be making a picture, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan, pointing
it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on making it, please,&rdquo; said Amabel; and she
sat down and watched him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like this wood, Bogy?&rdquo; she asked, softly,
after a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sleep in it, then?&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t sleep in a cellar, if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sleep in a cellar, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse <i>says</i> you do,&rdquo; said Amabel, nodding
emphatically.</p>
<p>Jan was at a loss how to express the full inaccuracy of
Nurse&rsquo;s statement in polite language, so he was silent;
rapidly adding tint to tint from his heap of leaves, whilst the
birds sang overhead, and Amabel sat with her two bundles watching
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were an old man!&rdquo; she said, at
length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look very bad,&rdquo; Amabel
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I be very bad,&rdquo; said Jan,
modestly.</p>
<p>Amabel&rsquo;s next questions came at short intervals, like
dropping shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you say your prayers, Bogy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you go to church, Bogy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where do you sit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the choir, Miss; the end next to Squire
Ammaby&rsquo;s big pew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do you</i>?&rdquo; said Amabel.&nbsp; She had been
threatened with Bogy for misbehavior in church, and it was
startling to find that he sat so near.&nbsp; She changed the
subject, under a hasty remembrance of having once made a face at
the parson through a hole in the bombazine curtains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you paint with paints, Bogy?&rdquo;
said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got none, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a paint-box,&rdquo; said Amabel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And, if you like, I&rsquo;ll give it to you,
Bogy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The color rushed to Jan&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Miss!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must dip the paints in water, you know, and rub
them on a plate; and don&rsquo;t let them lie in a puddle,&rdquo;
said Amabel, who loved to dictate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t put your brush in your mouth,&rdquo;
said Amabel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan.&nbsp; It had never
struck him that one could want to put a paint-brush in
one&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>At this point Amabel&rsquo;s overwrought energies suddenly
failed her, and she burst out crying.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know how I shall get over the wall,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee cry, Miss.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll help
you,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t walk any more,&rdquo; sobbed Amabel, who
was, indeed, tired out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;ee on my back,&rdquo; said
Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a good deal of difficulty, Amabel was hoisted up, and
planted her big feet in Jan&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; It was no light
pilgrimage for poor Jan, as he climbed the winding path.&nbsp;
Amabel was peevish with weariness; her bundles were sadly in the
way, and at every step a cup-moss or <i>marchantia</i> dropped
out, and Amabel insisted upon its being picked up.&nbsp; But they
reached the wall at last, and Jan got her over, and made two or
three expeditions after the missing mosses, before the little
lady was finally content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Bogy,&rdquo; she said, at last, holding up her
face to be kissed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And thank you very much.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not frightened of you, Bogy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jan kissed her, he said, smiling, &ldquo;What is your name,
love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she said, &ldquo;Amabel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her parents and guardians, Amabel made the following
statement: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Bogy.&nbsp; I like him.&nbsp;
He doesn&rsquo;t sleep in the cellar, so Nurse told a
story.&nbsp; And he didn&rsquo;t take me away, so that&rsquo;s
another story.&nbsp; He says his prayers, and he goes to church,
so he can&rsquo;t be the Bad Man.&nbsp; He makes pictures with
leaves.&nbsp; He carried me on his back, but not in a
bag&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>At this point the outraged feelings of Lady Craikshaw
exploded, and she rang the bell, and ordered Miss Amabel to be
put to bed with a dose of rhubarb and magnesia (without
sal-volatile), for telling stories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eau-de-Cologne, mamma dear, please,&rdquo; said
Lady Louisa, as the door closed on the struggling, screaming, and
protesting Amabel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it really
dreadful?&nbsp; But Esmerelda Ammaby says Henry used to tell
shocking stories when he was a little boy.&rdquo;</p>

188</span>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE
PAINT-BOX.&mdash;MASTER LINSEED&rsquo;S SHOP.&mdash;THE NEW
SIGN-BOARD.&mdash;MASTER SWIFT AS WILL SCARLET.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Sunday morning Jan took his
place in church with unusual feelings.&nbsp; He looked here,
there, and everywhere for the little damsel of the wood, but she
was not to be seen.&nbsp; Meanwhile she had not sent the paint
box, and he feared it would never come.&nbsp; He fancied she must
be the Squire&rsquo;s little daughter, but he was not sure, and
she certainly was not in the big pew, where the back of the
Squire&rsquo;s red head and Lady Louisa&rsquo;s aquiline nose
were alone visible.&nbsp; She was a dear little soul, he
thought.&nbsp; He wondered why she called him Bogy.&nbsp; Perhaps
it was a way little ladies had of addressing their inferiors.</p>
<p>Jan did not happen to guess that, Amabel being very young, the
morning services were too long for her.&nbsp; In the afternoon he
had given her up, but she was there.</p>
<p>The old Rector had reached the third division of his sermon,
and Lady Craikshaw was asleep, when Amabel, mounting the seat
with her usual vigor, pushed her Sunday hood through the
bombazine curtains, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bogy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan looked up, and then started to his feet as Amabel stuffed
the paint-box into his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;I pushed it under my
frock,&rdquo; she said in a stage whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;It made
me so tight?&nbsp; But grandmamma is such&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Jan heard and saw no more.&nbsp; Amabel&rsquo;s footing was
apt to be insecure; she slipped upon the cushions and disappeared
with a crash.</p>
<p>Jan trembled as he clasped the shallow old cedar-wood
box.&nbsp; He wondered if the colors would prove as bright as
those in the window.&nbsp; He fancied the wan, ascetic faces
there rejoiced with him.&nbsp; When he got home, he sat under the
shadow of the mill, and drew back the sliding lid of the
box.&nbsp; Brushes, and twelve hard color cakes.&nbsp; They were
Ackermann&rsquo;s, and very good.&nbsp; Cheap paint-boxes were
not made then.&nbsp; He read the names on the back of them:
Neutral Tint, Prussian Blue, Indian Red, Yellow Ochre, Brown
Madder, Brown Pink, Burnt Umber, Vandyke Brown, Indigo,
King&rsquo;s Yellow, Rose Madder, and Ivory Black.</p>
<p>It says much for Jan&rsquo;s uprightness of spirit, and for
the sense of duty in which the schoolmaster was training him,
that he did not neglect school for his new treasure.&nbsp;
Happily for him the sun rose early, and Jan rose with it, and
taking his paint-box to the little wood, on scraps of parcel
paper and cap paper, on bits of wood and smooth white stones, he
blotted-in studies of color, which he finished from memory at odd
moments in the windmill.</p>
<p>In the summer holidays, Jan had more time for sketching.&nbsp;
But the many occasions on which he could not take his paints with
him led him to observe closely, and taught him to paint from
memory with wonderful exactness.&nbsp; He was also obliged to
reduce his outlines and condense his effects to a very small
scale to economize paper.</p>
<p>About this time he heard that Master Chuter was going to have
a new sign painted for the inn.&nbsp; Master Linseed was to paint
it.</p>
<p>Master Linseed&rsquo;s shop had been a place of resort for Jan
in some of his leisure time.&nbsp; At first the painter and
decorator had been churlish enough to him, but, finding that Jan
was skilful with a brush, he employed him again and again to do
his work, for which he received instead of giving thanks.&nbsp;
Jan went there less after he got a paint-box, and could produce
effects with good materials of his own, instead of making
imperfect experiments in color on bits of wood in the
painter&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>But in this matter of the new sign-board he took the deepest
interest.&nbsp; He had a design of his own for it, which he was
most anxious the painter should adopt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look
&rsquo;ee, Master Linseed,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It be the
Heart of Oak.&nbsp; Now I know a oak-tree with a big trunk and
two arms.&nbsp; They stretches out one on each side, and the
little branches closes in above till &rsquo;tis just like a
heart.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be beautiful, Master Linseed, and I
could bring &rsquo;ee leaves of the oak so that &rsquo;ee could
match the yellows and greens.&nbsp; And then there&rsquo;d be
trees beyond and beyond, smaller and smaller, and all like a blue
mist between them, thee know.&nbsp; That blue in the paper
&rsquo;ee&rsquo;ve got would just do, and with more white to it
&rsquo;twould be beautiful for the sky.&nbsp;
And&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s to do all that for a few
shillings?&rdquo; broke in the painter, testily.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
Master Chuter wants it done and hung up for the Foresters&rsquo;
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the pressing nature of the commission was Master
Linseed&rsquo;s excuse for not adopting his idea for the sign, it
seemed strange to Jan that he did not set about it in some
fashion.&nbsp; But he delayed and delayed, till Master Chuter was
goaded to repeat the old rumor that real sign-painting was beyond
his powers.</p>
<p>It was within a week of the dinner that the little innkeeper
burst indignantly into the painter&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; Master
Linseed was ill in bed, and the sign-board lay untouched in a
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be a kind of fever that&rsquo;s on him,&rdquo; said
his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be a kind of fiddlestick!&rdquo; said the enraged
Master Chuter; and turning round his eye fell on Jan, who was
looking as disconsolate as himself.&nbsp; Day after day had he
come in hopes of seeing Master Linseed at work, and now it seemed
indefinitely postponed.&nbsp; But the innkeeper&rsquo;s face
brightened, and, seizing Jan by the shoulder, he dragged him from
the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee here, Jan Lake,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do &rsquo;ee thenk <i>thee</i> could paint the sign?&nbsp;
I dunno what I&rsquo;d give &rsquo;ee if &rsquo;ee could, if
&rsquo;twere only to spite that humbugging old hudmedud
yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan felt as if his brain were on fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
&rsquo;ee&rsquo;ll get me the things, Master Chuter,&rdquo; he
gasped, &ldquo;and&rsquo;ll let me paint it in your place,
I&rsquo;ll do it for &rsquo;ee for nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The innkeeper was not insensible to this consideration, but
his chief wish was to spite Master Linseed.&nbsp; He lost no time
in making ready, and for the rest of the week Jan lived between
the tallet (or hay-loft) of the inn and the wood where he had
first studied trees.&nbsp; Master Chuter provided him with sheets
of thick whitey-brown paper, on which he made water-color
studies, from which he painted afterwards.&nbsp; By his desire no
one was admitted to the tallet, though Master Chuter&rsquo;s
delight increased with the progress of the picture till the
secret was agony to him.&nbsp; Towards the end of the week they
were disturbed by a scuffling on the tallet stairs, and Rufus
bounced in, followed at a slower pace by the schoolmaster,
crying, &ldquo;Unearthed at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;
shouted Master Chuter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let Master Swift look,
Jan.&nbsp; He be a scholar, and&rsquo;ll tell us all about
un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jan shrank into the shadow.&nbsp; The schoolmaster stood
in the light of the open shutter, towards which the painting was
sloped, and Rufus sat by him on his haunches, and blinked with
all the gravity of a critic; and in the half light between them
and the stairs stood the fat little innkeeper, with his hands on
his knees, crying, &ldquo;There, Master Swift!&nbsp; Did
&rsquo;ee ever see any thing to beat that?&nbsp; Artis&rsquo; or
ammytoor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan&rsquo;s very blood seemed to stand still.&nbsp; As Master
Swift put on his spectacles, each fault in the painting sprang to
the front and mocked him.&nbsp; It was indeed a wretched
daub!</p>
<p>But Jan had been studying the scene under every lovely light
of heaven from dawn to dusk for a week of summer days: Master
Swift carried no such severe test in his brain.&nbsp; As he
raised his head, the tears were in his eyes, and he held out his
hand, saying, &ldquo;My lad, it&rsquo;s just the spirit of the
woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But d&rsquo;ye not think a figure or so would enliven
it?&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of Robin Hood&rsquo;s
foresters &lsquo;chasing the flying roe&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Foresters</i>!&nbsp; To be sure!&rdquo; said Master
Chuter.&nbsp; &ldquo;What did I say?&nbsp; Have the schoolmaster
in, says I.&nbsp; He be a scholar, and knows what&rsquo;s
what.&nbsp; Put &rsquo;em in, Jan, put &rsquo;em in!
there&rsquo;s plenty of room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Jan had already suffered from the innkeeper&rsquo;s
suggestions, only an artist can imagine, and his imagination will
need no help!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be main glad to get a bit of red in
there,&rdquo; said Jan, in a low voice, to Master Swift;
&ldquo;but Robin Hood must be in green, sir, mustn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Will Scarlet.&nbsp; Put Will in,&rdquo;
said Master Swift, who, pleased to be appealed to, threw himself
warmly into the matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;He can have just drawn his
bow at a deer out of sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with a charming
simplicity the old schoolmaster flung his burly figure into an
appropriate attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand so a minute!&rdquo; cried Jan, and seizing a lump
of charcoal, with which he had made his outlines, he rapidly
sketched Master Swift&rsquo;s figure on the floor of the
tallet.&nbsp; Thinned down to what he declared to have been his
dimensions in youth, it was transferred to Jan&rsquo;s picture,
and the touch of red was the culminating point of the
innkeeper&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>On the day of the dinner the new sign swung aloft.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t dry better anywhere,&rdquo; said Master
Chuter.</p>
<p>Jan &ldquo;found himself famous.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole parish
assembled to admire.&nbsp; The windmiller, in his amazement,
could not even find a proverb for the occasion, whilst Abel hung
about the door of the Heart of Oak, as if he had been the most
confirmed toper, saying to all incomers, &ldquo;Have &rsquo;ee
seen the new sign, sir?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas our Jan did
un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His fame would probably have spread more widely, but for a
more overwhelming interest which came to distract the
neighborhood, and which destroyed a neat little project of Master
Chuter&rsquo;s for running up a few tables amongst his
kidney-beans, as a kind of &ldquo;tea garden&rdquo; for folk from
outlying villages, who, coming in on Sunday afternoons to
service, should also want to see the work of the boy
sign-painter.</p>
<p>It is a curious instance of the inaccuracy of popular
impressions that, when Master Linseed died three days after the
Foresters&rsquo; dinner, it was universally believed that he had
been killed by vexation at Jan&rsquo;s success.&nbsp; Nor was
this tradition the less firmly fixed in the village annals, that
the disease to which he had succumbed spread like flames in a
gale.&nbsp; It produced a slight reaction of sentiment against
Jan.&nbsp; And his achievement was absolutely forgotten in the
shadow of the months that followed.</p>
<p>For it was that year long known in the history of the district
as the year of the Black Fever.</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">remember</span> a &ldquo;cholera
year&rdquo; in a certain big village.&nbsp; The activity of the
sanitary authorities (and many and vain had been the efforts to
rouse them to activity <i>before</i>) was, for them,
remarkable.&nbsp; A good many heads of households died with
fearful suddenness and not less fearful suffering.&nbsp; Several
nuisances were &ldquo;seen to,&rdquo; some tar-barrels were
burnt, and the scourge passed by.&nbsp; Not long ago a woman,
whose home is in a court where some of the most flagrant
nuisances existed, in talking to me, casually alluded to one of
them.&nbsp; It had been ordered to be removed, she said, in the
cholera year when the gentlemen were going round; but the cholera
went away, and it remained among those things which were
<i>not</i> &ldquo;seen to,&rdquo; and for aught I know flourishes
still.&nbsp; She was a sensible and affectionate person.&nbsp;
Living away from her home at that time, she became anxious at
once for the welfare of her relatives if they neglected to write
to her.&nbsp; But she had never an anxiety on the subject of that
unremedied abomination which was poisoning every breath they
drew.&nbsp; That &ldquo;the gentlemen who went round&rdquo; felt
it superfluous to have their orders carried out when strong men
were no longer sickening and dying within two revolutions of the
hands of the church clock will surprise no one who has had to do
with local sanitary officers.&nbsp; They are like the children of
Israel, and will only do their duty under the pressure of a
plague.&nbsp; The people themselves are more like the
Egyptians.&nbsp; Plagues won&rsquo;t convince them.&nbsp; A
mother with all her own and her neighbors&rsquo; children
sickening about her would walk miles in a burst shoe to fetch the
doctor or a big bottle of medicine, but she won&rsquo;t walk
three yards farther than usual to draw her house-water from the
well that the sewer doesn&rsquo;t leak into.&nbsp; That is a
fact, not a fable; and, in the cases I am thinking of, all
medical remonstrance was vain.&nbsp; Uneducated people will take
any thing in from the doctor through their mouths, but little or
nothing through their ears.</p>
<p>When such is the state of matters in busy, stirring districts,
among shrewd artisans, and when our great seat of learning smells
as it does smell under the noses of the professors, it is
needless to say that the &ldquo;black fever&rdquo; found every
household in the little village prepared to contribute to its
support, and met with hardly an obstacle on its devastating
path.</p>
<p>To comment on Master Salter&rsquo;s qualifications for the
post of sanitary inspector would be to insult the reader&rsquo;s
understanding.&nbsp; Of course he owned several of the
picturesque little cottages where the refuse had to be pitched
out at the back, and the slops chucked out in front, and where
the general arrangements for health, comfort, and decency were
such as one must forbear to speak of, since, on such matters, our
ears&mdash;Heaven help us!&mdash;have all that delicacy which
seems denied to our noses.</p>
<p>If the causes of the calamity were little understood, portents
were plentifully noted.&nbsp; The previous winter had been
mild.&nbsp; A thunderbolt fell in the autumn.&nbsp; There was a
blight on the gooseberries, and Master Salter had a calf with two
heads.&nbsp; As to the painter, a screech-owl had been heard to
cry from his chimney-top, not three weeks before his death.</p>
<p>There was a pause of a day or so after Master Linseed died,
and then victims fell thick and fast.&nbsp; Children playing
happily with their mimic boats on the open drain that ran lazily
under the noontide sun, by the footpath of the main street, were
coffined for their hasty burial before the sun had next reached
his meridian.&nbsp; The tears were hardly dry in their
parents&rsquo; eyes before these also were closed in their last
sleep.&nbsp; The very aged seemed to linger on, but strong men
sickened and died; and at the end of the week more than one woman
was left sitting by an empty hearth, a worn-out creature whom
Death seemed only to have forgotten to take away.</p>
<p>At first there was a reckless disregard of infection among the
neighbors.&nbsp; But, after one or two of these family
desolations, this was succeeded by a panic, and even the noble
charity which the poor commonly show to each other&rsquo;s
troubles failed, and no one could be got to nurse the sick or
bury the dead.</p>
<p>Now the Rector was an old man.&nbsp; Most of the parish
officers were aged, and patriarchs in white smock frocks were as
plentiful as creepers at the cottage doors.&nbsp; The healthy
breezes and the dull pace at which life passed in the district
seemed to make men slow to wear out.&nbsp; If the Rector had
profited by these features of the parish in health, it must be
confessed that they had also had their influence on his
career.&nbsp; He was a good man, and a learned one.&nbsp; He
stuck close to his living, and he was benevolent.&nbsp; But he
was not of those heroic natures who can resist the influence of
the mental atmosphere around them; and in a dull parish, in a
sleepy age, he had not been an active parson.&nbsp; Some men,
however, who cannot make opportunities for themselves, can do
nobly enough if the chance comes to them; and this chance came to
the Rector in his sixty-ninth year, on the wings of the black
fever.&nbsp; To quicken spiritual life in the soul of a Master
Salter he had not the courage even to attempt; but a panic of
physical cowardice had not a temptation for him.&nbsp; And so it
came about that of four men who stayed the panic, by the example
of their own courage, who went from house to house, and from
sick-bed to sick-bed&mdash;who drew a cordon round the parish,
and established kitchens and a temporary hospital, and nursed the
sick, and encouraged the living, and buried the dead,&mdash;the
most active was the old Rector.</p>
<p>The other three were the parish doctor, Squire Ammaby, and the
schoolmaster.</p>
<p>On the very first rumor of the epidemic, Lady Louisa had
carried off Amabel, and had gone with Lady Craikshaw to
Brighton.&nbsp; Both the ladies were indignant with the
Squire&rsquo;s obstinate resolve to remain amongst his
tenants.&nbsp; In her alarm, Lady Louisa implored him to sell the
property and buy one in Ireland, which was Lady Craikshaw&rsquo;s
native country; and the list she contrived to run up of the
drawbacks to the Ammaby estate would have driven a temper less
stolid than her husband&rsquo;s to distraction.</p>
<p>When the fever broke out among the children, the schools were
closed, and Master Swift devoted his whole time to laboring with
the parson, the doctor, and the Squire.</p>
<p>No part of the Rector&rsquo;s devotion won more affectionate
gratitude from his people than a single act of thoughtfulness, by
which he preserved a record of the graves of their dead.&nbsp; He
had held firmly on to a decent and reverent burial, and,
foreseeing that the poor survivors would be quite unable to
afford gravestones, he kept a strict list of the dead, and where
they were buried, which was afterwards transferred to one large
monument, which was bought by subscription.&nbsp; He cut the
village off from all communication with the outer world, to
prevent a spread of the disease; but he sent accounts of the
calamity to the public papers, which brought abundant help in
money for the needs of the parish.&nbsp; And in these matters the
schoolmaster was his right-hand man.</p>
<p>The disease was most eccentric in its path.&nbsp; Having
scourged one side only of the main street, it burst out with
virulence in detached houses at a distance.&nbsp; Then it
returned to the village, and after lulls and outbreaks it ceased
as suddenly as it began.</p>
<p>It was about midway in its career that it fell with all its
wrath upon Master Lake&rsquo;s windmill.</p>
<p>The mill stood in a healthy position, but the dwelling room
was ill-ventilated, and there were defective sanitary
arrangements, which Master Swift had anxiously pointed out to the
miller.&nbsp; The plague had begun in the village, and the
schoolmaster trembled for Jan.&nbsp; But Master Lake was not to
be interfered with, and, when the schoolmaster spoke of poison,
thought himself witty as he replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be a uncommon slow pison then, Master
Swift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must also be allowed that such epidemics, once started, do
havoc in apparently clean houses and amongst well-fed people.</p>
<p>It was a little foster-sister of Jan&rsquo;s who sickened
first.&nbsp; She died within two days.&nbsp; Her burial was hasty
enough, but Mrs. Lake had no time to fret about that, for a
second child was ill.&nbsp; Like many another householder, the
poor windmiller was now ready enough to look to his drains, and
so forth; but it may be doubted if the general stirring up of
dirty places at this moment did not do as much harm as
good.&nbsp; It was hot,&mdash;terribly hot.&nbsp; Day after day
passed without a breeze to cool the burning skins of the sick,
and yet it was not sunshiny.&nbsp; People did say that the
pestilence hung like a murky vapor above the district, and hid
the sun.</p>
<p>Trades were slack, corn-grinding amongst the rest, and Master
Lake did the housework, helped by Jan and Abel.&nbsp; He was
stunned by the suddenness and the weight of the calamity which
had come to him.&nbsp; He was very kind to Mrs. Lake, but the
poor woman was almost past any feeling but that which, as a sort
of instinct or inspiration, guided a constant watching and
waiting on her sick children.&nbsp; She never slept, and would
not have eaten, but that Master Lake used his authority to force
some food upon her.&nbsp; At this time Jan&rsquo;s chief
occupations were cookery and dish-washing.&nbsp; His constant
habit of observation made all the experiences of life an
education for him; he had often watched his foster-mother prepare
the family meals, and he prepared them now, for Abel and the
windmiller could not, and she was with the sick children.</p>
<p>Before the second child died, two more fell ill on the same
day.&nbsp; Only Abel and Jan were still
&ldquo;about.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mother moved like an automaton,
and never spoke.&nbsp; Now and then a deep sigh or a low moan
would escape her, and the miller would move tenderly to her side,
and say, &ldquo;Bear up, missus; bear up, my lass,&rdquo; and
then go back to his pipe and his cherry-wood chair, where he
seemed to grow gray as he sat.</p>
<p>Master Swift came from time to time to the mill.&nbsp; He was
everywhere, helping, comforting, and exhorting.&nbsp; Some said
his face shone with the light of another world, for which he was
&ldquo;marked.&rdquo;&nbsp; Others whispered that the strain was
telling on him, and that it wore the look it had had in the brief
insanity which followed his child&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; But all
agreed that the very sight of him brought help and
consolation.&nbsp; The windmiller grew to watch for him, and to
lean on him in the helplessness of his despair.&nbsp; And he
listened humbly to the old man&rsquo;s fervid religious
counsels.&nbsp; His own little threads of philosophy were all
blowing loose and useless in this storm of trouble.</p>
<p>The evening that Master Swift came up to arrange about the
burial of the second child, he found the other two just
dead.&nbsp; The first two had suffered much and been delirious,
but these two had sunk painlessly in a few hours, and had fallen
asleep for the last time in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>It did not lessen the force of Master Swift&rsquo;s somewhat
stern consolations that in all good faith he conveyed in them an
expectation that the Last Day was at hand.&nbsp; Many people
thought so, and it was, perhaps, not unnatural.&nbsp; In these
days, which were long years of suffering, they were shut off from
the rest of humanity, and the village was the world to
them,&mdash;a world very near its end.&nbsp; With Death so busy,
it seemed as if Judgment could hardly linger long.</p>
<p>It is true that this did not form a part of the Rector&rsquo;s
religious exhortations.&nbsp; But some good people were shocked
by the tea-party that he gave to the young people of the place,
and the games that followed it in the Rectory meads, at the very
height of the fever; though the doctor said it was better than a
hogshead of medicine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To encourage low spirits in this panic is just to
promote suicide, if ye like the responsibeelity of that,&rdquo;
said the doctor to Master Swift, who had confided his doubts as
to the seemliness of the entertainment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell ye
there&rsquo;s a lairge proportion of folk dies just because their
neighbors have died before them, for the want of their attention
being directed to something else.&nbsp; Away wi&rsquo; ye,
schoolmaster, and take your tuning-fork to ask the blessing
wi&rsquo;.&nbsp; What says the Scripture, man?&nbsp; &lsquo;The
living, the living, he shall praise Thee!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor was a Scotchman, and Master Swift always listened
with sympathy to a North countryman.&nbsp; He was convinced, too,
and took his tuning-fork to the meals, and led the grace.</p>
<p>Nor could his expectation of the speedy end of all things
restrain his instinctive anxiety and watchfulness for Jan&rsquo;s
health.&nbsp; On the evening of that visit to the mill, he used
some little manoeuvring to accomplish Jan&rsquo;s being sent back
with him to the village, to arrange for the burial of the three
children.</p>
<p>A glow of satisfaction suffused his rough face as he got Jan
out of the tainted house into the fresh evening air, though it
paled again before that other look which was now habitual to him,
as, waving his hand towards the ripening corn-fields, he quoted
from one of Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s loftiest hymns,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We talk of harvests,&mdash;there are no
such things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But when we leave our corn and hay.<br />
There is no fruitful year but that which brings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The last and loved, though dreadful Day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, show Thyself
to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or take me up to
Thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE BEASTS OF THE
VILLAGE.&mdash;ABEL SICKENS.&mdash;THE GOOD SHEPHERD.&mdash;RUFUS
PLAYS THE PHILANTHROPIST.&mdash;MASTER SWIFT SEES THE SUN
RISE.&mdash;THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Amid</span> the havoc made by the fever
amongst men, women, and children, the immunity of the beasts and
birds had a sad strangeness.</p>
<p>There was a small herd of pigs which changed hands three times
in ten days.&nbsp; The last purchaser hesitated, and was only
induced by the cheapness of the bargain to suppress a feeling
that they brought ill-luck.&nbsp; Cats mewed wistfully about
desolated hearths.&nbsp; One dog moaned near the big grave in
which his master lay, and others, with sad sagacious eyes, went
to look for new friends and homes.</p>
<p>It was a day or two after the burial of the miller&rsquo;s
three children, that, as Jan sat at dinner with Abel and his two
parents, he was struck by the way in which the mill cats hung
about Abel, purring and rubbing themselves against his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think they misses the others,&rdquo; he whispered
to his foster-brother, and his tears fell thick and fast on to
his plate.</p>
<p>Abel made no answer.&nbsp; He did not wish Jan to know that he
had given all his food by bits to the cats, because he could not
swallow it himself.&nbsp; But, later in the day, Jan found him in
the round-house, lying on an empty sack, with his head against a
full one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee tell mother,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;but I do feel bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as Jan sat down, and put his arms about him, on the very
spot where they had so often sat together, learning the alphabet
and educating their thumbs, Abel laid his head on his
foster-brother&rsquo;s shoulder, saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think, Janny dear, that Mary, she wants me, and
the others too.&nbsp; I think I be going after them.&nbsp; But
thee&rsquo;ll look to mother, Janny dear, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>I</i> want thee, too, Abel dear,&rdquo; sobbed
Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be thinking perhaps them that brought thee
hither&rsquo;ll fetch thee away some day, Jan.&nbsp; But
thee&rsquo;ll see to mother?&rdquo; repeated Abel, his eyes
wandering restlessly with a look of pain.</p>
<p>Jan knew now that he was only an adopted child of the
windmill, though he stoutly ignored the fact, being very fond of
his foster-parents.</p>
<p>Abel&rsquo;s illness came with the force of a fresh
blow.&nbsp; There had been a slight pause in the course of the
fever at the mill, and it seemed as if these two boys were to be
spared.&nbsp; Abel had been busy helping his father to burn the
infected bedding, etc., that very morning, and at night he lay
raving.</p>
<p>He raved of Jan&rsquo;s picture which swung unheeded above
Master Chuter&rsquo;s door, and confused it with some
church-window that he seemed to fancy Jan had painted; then of
his dead brothers and sisters.&nbsp; And then from time to time
he rambled about a great flock of sheep which he saw covering the
vast plains about the windmill, and which he wearied himself in
trying to count.&nbsp; And, as he tossed, he complained in
piteous tones about some man who seemed to be the shepherd, and
who would not do something that Abel wanted.</p>
<p>For the most part, he knew no one but Jan, and then only when
Jan touched him.&nbsp; It seemed to give him pleasure.&nbsp; He
understood nothing that was said to him, except in brief
intervals.&nbsp; Once, after a short sleep, he opened his eyes
and recognized the schoolmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Swift,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do &rsquo;ee think
that be our Lord among them sheep?&nbsp; With His hair falling
on&rsquo;s shoulders, and the light round His head, and the long
frock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Swift&rsquo;s eyes turned involuntarily in the
direction in which Abel&rsquo;s were gazing.&nbsp; He saw nothing
but the dark corners of the dwelling-room; but he
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Abel, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be His frock all red for, then?&nbsp; Bright red,
like blood.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis like them figures
in&mdash;in&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Here Abel wandered again, and only muttered to himself.&nbsp;
But when Jan crept near to him, and touching him said, &ldquo;The
figures in the window, Abel dear,&rdquo; he opened his eyes and
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it be, Janny.&nbsp; With the sun shining through
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Thee knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he wailed fretfully,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do He keep His back to me all along?&nbsp; I
follows Him up and down, all over, till I be tired.&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t He turn His face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan was speechless from tears, but the old schoolmaster took
Abel&rsquo;s hot hand in his, and said, with infinite
tenderness,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will, my lad.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll turn His face to
thee very soon.&nbsp; Wait for Him, Abel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do &rsquo;ee think so?&rdquo; said Abel.&nbsp; And
after a while he muttered, &ldquo;You be the schoolmaster, and
ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, seemingly satisfied, he dozed once more.</p>
<p>Master Swift hurried away.&nbsp; He had business in the
village, and he wanted to catch the doctor, and ask his opinion
of Abel&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will be get round, sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The doctor shook his head, and Master Swift felt a double
pang.&nbsp; He was sorry about Abel, but the real object of his
anxiety was Jan.&nbsp; Once he had hoped the danger was past, but
the pestilence seemed still in full strength at the windmill, and
the agonizing conviction strengthened in his mind that once more
his hopes were to be disappointed, and the desire of his eyes was
to be snatched away.&nbsp; The doctor thought that he was
grieving for Abel, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as sorry as yourself.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a
fine lad, with something angelic about the face, when ye separate
it from its surroundings.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;ve no constitution
in that family.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just the want of strength in
him, and not the strength of the fever, this time; for the
virulence of the poison&rsquo;s abating.&nbsp; The cases are
recovering now, except where other causes intervene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Swift felt almost ashamed of the bound in his
spirits.&nbsp; But the very words which shut out all hope of
Abel&rsquo;s recovery opened a possible door of escape for
Jan.&nbsp; He was not one of the family, and it was reasonable to
hope that his constitution might be of sterner stuff.&nbsp; He
turned with a lighter heart into his cottage, where he purposed
to get some food and then return to the mill.&nbsp; There might
be a lucid interval before the end, in which the pious Abel might
find comfort from his lips; and if Jan sickened, he would nurse
him night and day.</p>
<p>Rufus welcomed his master not merely with cordiality, but with
fussiness.&nbsp; The partly apologetic character of his greeting
was accounted for when a half starved looking dog emerged from
beneath the table, and, not being immediately kicked, wagged the
point of its tail feebly, keeping at a respectful distance,
whilst Rufus introduced it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ye&rsquo;re for playing the philanthropist, are
ye?&rdquo; said Master Swift.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve picked up
one of these poor houseless, masterless creatures?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not for undervaluing disinterested charity, Rufus, my
man; but I wish ye&rsquo;d had the luck to light on a better bred
beast while ye were about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, no disadvantage to what we call &ldquo;dumb
animals&rdquo; if they understand the general drift of our
remarks without minutely following every word.&nbsp; They have
generally the sense, too, to leave well alone, and, without
pressing the question of the new comer&rsquo;s adoption, the two
dogs curled themselves round, put their noses into their pockets,
and went to sleep with an air of its being unnecessary to pursue
the topic farther.</p>
<p>Master Swift shared his meal with them, and left them to keep
house when he returned to the mill.</p>
<p>His quick eye, doubly quickened by experience and by anxiety,
saw that Jan&rsquo;s were full of fever, and his limbs
languid.&nbsp; But he would not quit Abel&rsquo;s side, and
Master Swift remained with the afflicted family.</p>
<p>Abel muttered deliriously all night, with short intervals of
complete stupor.&nbsp; The fever, like a fire, consumed his
strength, and the fancy that he was toiling over the downs seemed
to weary him as if he had really been on foot.&nbsp; Just before
sunrise, Master Swift left him asleep, and went to breathe some
out-door air.</p>
<p>The fresh, tender light of early morning was over every
thing.&nbsp; The windmill stood up against the red-barred sky
with outlines softened by the clinging dew.&nbsp; The plains
glistened, and across them, through the pure air, came the voice
of Master Salter&rsquo;s chanticleer from the distant farm.</p>
<p>It was such a contrast to the scene within that Master Swift
burst into tears.&nbsp; But even as he wept the sun leaped to the
horizon, and, reflected from every dewdrop, and from the very
tears upon the old man&rsquo;s cheeks, flooded the world about
him with its inimitable glory.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster uncovered his head, and kneeling upon the
short grass prayed passionately for the dying boy.&nbsp; But, as
he knelt in the increasing sunshine, his prayers for the peace of
the departing soul unconsciously passed almost into thanksgiving
that so soon, and so little stained, it should exchange the dingy
sick-room&mdash;not for these sweet summer days, which lose their
sweetness!&mdash;but to taste, in peace which passeth
understanding, what <span class="smcap">God</span> has prepared
for them that love Him.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was whilst the schoolmaster still knelt outside the
windmill that Abel awoke, and raised his eyes to Jan&rsquo;s with
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee must go out a bit soon, Janny dear,&rdquo; he
whispered, &ldquo;it be such a lovely day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan was too much pleased to hear him speak to wonder how he
knew what kind of a day it was, and Abel lay with his head in
Jan&rsquo;s arms, breathing painfully and gazing before
him.&nbsp; Suddenly he raised himself, and cried,&mdash;so loudly
that the old man outside heard the cry,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janny dear!&nbsp; He&rsquo;ve turned his face to
me.&nbsp; He be coming right to me.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp;
He&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>But <span class="smcap">He</span> had come.</p>

211</span>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">JAN HAS THE
FEVER.&mdash;CONVALESCENCE IN MASTER SWIFT&rsquo;S
COTTAGE.&mdash;THE SQUIRE ON DEMORALIZATION.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jan</span> took the fever.&nbsp; He was
very ill, too, partly from grief at Abel&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; He
had also a not unnatural conviction that he would die, which was
unfavorable to his recovery.</p>
<p>The day on which he gave Master Swift his old etching as a
last bequest, he fairly infected him also with this belief, and
during a necessary visit to the village the schoolmaster hung up
the little picture in his cottage with a breaking heart.</p>
<p>But the next time Rufus saw him, he came to prepare for a
visitor.&nbsp; Jan was recovering, and Master Swift had persuaded
the windmiller to let him come to the cottage for a few days, the
rather that Mrs. Lake was going to stay with a relative whilst
the windmill was thoroughly cleansed and disinfected.&nbsp; The
weather was delightful now, and, feeble as he had become, Jan
soon grew strong again.&nbsp; If he had not done so, it would
have been from no lack of care on Master Swift&rsquo;s
part.&nbsp; The old schoolmaster was a thrifty man, and had some
money laid by, or he would have been somewhat pinched at this
time.&nbsp; As it was, he drew freely upon his savings for
Jan&rsquo;s benefit, and made many expeditions to the town to buy
such delicacies as he thought might tempt his appetite.&nbsp; Nor
was this all.&nbsp; The morning when Jan came languidly into the
kitchen from the little inner room, where he and the schoolmaster
slept, he saw his precious paint-box on the table, to fetch which
Master Swift had been to the windmill.&nbsp; And by it lay a
square book with the word <i>Sketch-book</i> in ornamental
characters on the binding, a couple of Cumberland lead drawing
pencils, and a three-penny chunk of bottle India-rubber,
delicious to smell.</p>
<p>If the schoolmaster had had any twinges of regret as he bought
these things, in defiance of his principles for Jan&rsquo;s
education, they melted utterly away in view of his delight, and
the glow that pleasure brought into his pale cheeks.&nbsp; Master
Swift was regarded, too, by a colored sketch of Rufus sitting at
table in his arm-chair, with his more mongrel friend on the floor
beside him.&nbsp; It was the best sketch that Jan had yet
accomplished.&nbsp; But most people are familiar with the curious
fact that one often makes an unaccountable stride in an art after
it has been laid aside for a time.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that Master Swift had neglected his
duties in the village, or left the Parson, the Squire, and the
doctor to struggle on alone, during the illness of Abel and of
Jan.&nbsp; Even now he was away from the cottage for the greater
part of the day, and Jan was left to keep house with the
dogs.&nbsp; His presence gave great contentment to Rufus, if it
scarcely lessened the melancholy dignity of his countenance; for
dogs who live with human beings never like being left long
alone.&nbsp; And Jan, for his own part, could have wished for
nothing better than to sit at the table where he had once hoped
to make leaf-pictures, and paint away with materials that
Rembrandt himself would not have disdained.</p>
<p>The pestilence had passed away.&nbsp; But the labors of the
Rector and his staff rather increased than diminished at this
particular point.&nbsp; To say nothing of those vile wretches who
seem to spring out of such calamities as putrid matter breeds
vermin, and who use them as opportunities for plunder, there were
a good many people to be dealt with of a lighter shade of
demoralization,&mdash;people who had really suffered, and whose
daily work had been unavoidably stopped, but to whom idleness was
so pleasant, and the fame of their misfortunes so gratifying,
that they preferred to scramble on in dismantled homes, on the
alms extracted by their woes, to setting about such labor as
would place them in comfort.&nbsp; Then that large
class&mdash;the shiftless&mdash;was now doubly large, and there
were widows and orphans in abundance, and there was hardly a bed
or a blanket in the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said Mr. Ammaby, joining the Rector
as he sat at breakfast, &ldquo;to beg you, in the interests of
the village, to check the flow of that fount of benevolence which
springs eternal in the clerical pocket.&nbsp; You will ruin us
with your shillings and half crowns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul, Ammaby,&rdquo; said the Rector, pausing
with an eggshell transfixed upon his spoon, &ldquo;shillings and
half crowns don&rsquo;t go far in the present condition of our
households.&nbsp; There are not ten families whose beds are not
burnt.&nbsp; What do you propose to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, when I have first confessed that
my ideas are not entirely original.&nbsp; I have been studying
political economy under that hard-headed Sandy, our friend the
doctor.&nbsp; In the first place, from to-morrow, we must cease
to <i>give</i> any thing whatever, and both announce that
determination and stick to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>then</i>, my dear sir?&rdquo; said the Rector,
smiling; and nursing his black gaiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>then</i>, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Ammaby,
&ldquo;I shall be able to get some men to do some work about my
place, and those people at a distance who have widows here will
relieve them (at least the widows will look up their well-to-do
relatives), and the Church, in your person, will not be
charged.&nbsp; And some of the widows will consent to scrub for
payment, instead of sitting weeping in your kitchen&mdash;also
for payment.&nbsp; They will, furthermore, compel their
interesting sons to mind pigs, or scare birds, instead of hanging
about the Heart of Oak, begging of the visitors who now begin to
invade us.&nbsp; Do you know that the very boys won&rsquo;t
settle to work, that the children are taking to gutter-life and
begging, that the women won&rsquo;t even tidy up their houses,
and that the men are retailing the horrors of the fever in every
alehouse in the county, instead of getting in the crops?&nbsp; I
give you my word, I had to go down to the inn yesterday, and a
lad of eleven or twelve, who didn&rsquo;t recognize me in
Chuter&rsquo;s dark kitchen, came up and began to beg with a
whine that would have done credit to a professional
mendicant.&nbsp; I stood in the shadow and let him tell his whole
story, of a widowed mother and three brothers and sisters living,
and six dead; and when he&rsquo;d finished, and two visitors were
fumbling in their pockets, I took him by the collar and lifted
him clean through the kitchen and down the yard into the
street.&nbsp; I nearly knocked Swift over, or rather I nearly
fell myself, from concussion with his burly person, but he was
the very man I wanted.&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;Mr. Swift, may I ask
you to do me a favor?&nbsp; This boy&mdash;whose father was a
respectable man&mdash;has been begging&mdash;<i>begging</i>! in a
public room.&nbsp; His excuse is that his mother is
starving.&nbsp; Will you kindly take him to the Hall, and put him
in charge of the gardener, with my strict orders that he is to do
a good afternoon&rsquo;s work at weeding in the shrubbery.&nbsp;
And that the gardener is to see that he comes every day at nine
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and works there till four in the
afternoon, till the day you reopen school, meal-times and Sundays
excepted.&nbsp; I will pay his mother five shillings a week, and,
if he is a good boy, I&rsquo;ll give him some old clothes.&nbsp;
And if ever you see or hear of his disgracing himself and his
friends by begging again, if you don&rsquo;t thrash him within an
inch of his life, I shall.&rsquo;&nbsp; I promise you, the widow
might starve for the want of that five shillings if the young
gentleman could slip out of his bargain.&nbsp; His face was a
study.&nbsp; But less so than the schoolmaster&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
job exactly suited him, and I suspect he knew the lad of
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve heard Swift say, I fancy he
sympathizes with your theories,&rdquo; said the Rector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear he sympathizes with my temper as well as my
theories!&rdquo; laughed the Squire.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I felt the
flush on my own cheek-bone, I caught the fire in his eye.&nbsp;
But now, my dear sir, you will consent to some strong measures to
prevent the village becoming a mere nest of
<i>lazzaroni</i>?&nbsp; Let us try the system at any rate.&nbsp;
I propose that we do not shut up the soup kitchen yet, but charge
a small sum for the soup towards its expenses.&nbsp; And I want
to beg you to write another of those graphic and persuasive
letters, in which you have appealed to the sympathy of the public
with our misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, bless me!&rdquo; said the Rector, &ldquo;I thought
you were a foe to assisting the people, even out of their own
parson&rsquo;s pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I taunted the doctor myself with inconsistency,
but we do not propose to make a sixpenny dole of the fund.&nbsp;
You know there are certain things they can&rsquo;t do, and some
help they seem fairly entitled to receive.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve made
them burn their bedding, in the interests of the public safety,
and it&rsquo;s only fair they should be helped to replace
it.&nbsp; Then there is a lot of sanitary work which can only be
done by a fund for the purpose; and, if we get the money, we can
employ idlers.&nbsp; The women will tidy their houses when they
see new blankets, and the sooner the churchyard is made nice, and
that monument of yours erected, and we all get into orderly,
respectable ways again, the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, enough, my dear Ammaby!&rdquo; cried the
Rector; &ldquo;I put myself in your hands, and I will see to the
public appeal at once; though I may mention that the credit of
those compositions chiefly belongs to old Swift.&nbsp; He knows
the <i>data</i> minutely, and he delights in the putting
together.&nbsp; I think he regards it as a species of literary
work.&nbsp; I hope you hear good news of Lady Louisa and little
Amabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are quite well, thank you,&rdquo; said the Squire;
&ldquo;they are in town just now with Lady Craikshaw, who has
gone up to consult her London doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, farewell, Ammaby, for the present.&nbsp; Tell the
doctor I&rsquo;ll give his plan a trial, and we&rsquo;ll get the
place into working order as fast as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be charmed,&rdquo; said the Squire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He says, as we are going on now, we are breeding two worse
pests than the fever,&mdash;contentment under remediable
discomfort, and a dislike to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">MR. FORD&rsquo;S
CLIENT.&mdash;THE HISTORY OF JAN&rsquo;S FATHER&mdash;AMABEL AND
BOGY THE SECOND.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many sounds blended into
that one which roared for ever round Mr. Ford&rsquo;s offices in
the city was the cry of the newsboys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horful p&rsquo;ticklers of the plague in a village in
&mdash;shire!&rdquo; they screamed under the windows.&nbsp; Not
that Mr. Ford heard them.&nbsp; But in five minutes the noiseless
door opened, and a clerk laid the morning paper on the table, and
withdrew in silence.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Ford cut it leisurely with a
large ivory knife, and skimmed the news.&nbsp; His eye happened
to fall upon the Rector&rsquo;s letter, which, after a short
summary of the history of the fever, pointed out the objects for
which help was immediately required.&nbsp; There was a
postscript.&nbsp; To give some idea of the ravages of the
epidemic, and as a proof that the calamity was not exaggerated, a
list of some of the worst cases was given, with names and
particulars.&nbsp; It was gloomy enough.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary Smith,
lost her husband (a laborer) and six children between the second
and the ninth of the month.&nbsp; George Harness, a blacksmith,
lost his wife and four children.&nbsp; Master Abel Lake,
windmiller of the Tower Mill, lost all his children, five in
number, between the fifth and the fifteenth of the month.&nbsp;
His wife&rsquo;s health is completely broken up&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>At this point Mr. Ford dropped the paper, and, unlocking a
drawer beside him, referred to some memoranda, after which he cut
out the Rector&rsquo;s letter with a large pair of office
scissors, and enclosed it in one which he wrote before proceeding
to any other business.&nbsp; He had underlined one name in the
doleful list,&mdash;<i>Abel Lake</i>, <i>windmiller</i>.</p>
<p>Some hours later the silent clerk ushered in a visitor, one of
Mr. Ford&rsquo;s clients.&nbsp; He was a gentleman of middle
height and middle age,&mdash;the younger half of middle age,
though his dark hair was prematurely gray.&nbsp; His eyes were
black and restless, and his manner at once haughty and
nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to see you, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr.
Ford, suavely; &ldquo;I had just written you a note, the subject
of which I can now speak about.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as he spoke,
Mr. Ford tore open the letter which lay beside him, whilst his
client was saying, &ldquo;We are only passing through town on our
way to Scotland.&nbsp; I shall be here two nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember instructing me that it was your wish to
economize as much as possible during the minority of your
son?&rdquo; said Mr. Ford.&nbsp; His client nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; continued the man of business,
&ldquo;there is a quarterly payment we have been in the habit of
making on your account, which is now at an end.&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
as he spoke, he pushed the Rector&rsquo;s letter across the
table, with his fingers upon the name <i>Abel Lake</i>,
<i>windmiller</i>.&nbsp; His client always spoke stiffly, which
made the effort with which he now spoke less noticed by the
lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like to be certain,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean, that there is no exaggeration or
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never communicated with the man, or given him
any chance of pestering you,&rdquo; said Mr. Ford.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should hardly do so now, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly kept the power of reopening communication
in my own hands, knowing nothing of the man; but I should be
sorry to discontinue the allowance under a&mdash;a mistake of any
kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ford meditated.&nbsp; It may be said here that he by no
means knew all that the reader knows of Jan&rsquo;s history; but
he saw that his client was anxious not to withhold the money if
the child were alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have it, my dear sir,&rdquo; he said
suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allow me to write, in my own name, to this
worthy clergyman.&nbsp; I must ask you to subscribe to his fund,
in my name, which will form an excuse for the letter, and I will
contrive to ask him if the list of cases has been printed
accurately, and has his sanction.&nbsp; If there has been any
error, we shall hear of it.&nbsp; The object of the subscription
is&mdash;let me see&mdash;is&mdash;a monument to those who have
died of the fever and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>But the dark gentleman had started up abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, Mr. Ford,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;your plan is, as usual, excellent.&nbsp; Pray oblige me by
sending ten guineas in your own name, and you will let me know
if&mdash;if there <i>is</i> any mistake.&nbsp; I will call in
to-morrow about other matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before Mr. Ford could reply his client was gone.</p>
<p>The peculiar solitude to be found in the crowded heart of
London was grateful to his present mood.&nbsp; To have been alone
with his thoughts in the country would have been
intolerable.&nbsp; The fields smack of innocence, and alone with
them the past is apt to take the simple tints of right and wrong
in the memory.&nbsp; But in that seething mass, which represents
ten thousand heartaches and anxieties, doubtful shifts, and open
sins, as bad or worse than a man&rsquo;s own, there is a silent
sympathy and no reproach.&nbsp; Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client did not
lean back, the tension of his mind was too great.&nbsp; He sat
stiffly, and gazed vacantly before him, half seeing and half
transforming into other visions whatever lay before the hansom,
as it wound its way through the streets.&nbsp; Now for a moment a
four-wheeled cab, loaded with schoolboy luggage, occupied the
field of view, and idle memories of his own boyhood flitted over
it.&nbsp; Then, crawling behind a dray, some strange associations
built up the barrels into an old weatherstained wooden house in
Holland, and for a while an intense realization of past scenes
which love had made happy put present anxieties to sleep.&nbsp;
But they woke again with a horrible pang, as a grim, hideous
funeral car drove slowly past, nodding like a nightmare.</p>
<p>As the traffic became less dense, and the cab went faster, the
man&rsquo;s thoughts went faster too.&nbsp; He strove to do what
he had not often tried, to review his life.&nbsp; He had
unconsciously gained the will to do it, because a reparation
which conscience might hitherto have pressed on him was now
impossible, and because the plague that had desolated Abel
Lake&rsquo;s home had swept the skeleton out of his own cupboard,
and he could repent of the past and do his duty in the
future.&nbsp; His conscience was stronger than his courage.&nbsp;
He had long wished to repent, though he had not found strength to
repair.</p>
<p>On one point he did not delude himself as he looked back over
his life.&nbsp; He had no sentimental regrets for the careless
happiness of youth.&nbsp; Is any period of human life so
tormented with cares as a self-indulgent youth?&nbsp; He had been
a slave to expensive habits, to social traditions, to past
follies, ever since he could remember.&nbsp; He had been in debt,
in pocket or in conscience, from his schoolboy days to this
hour.&nbsp; His tradesmen were paid long since, and, if death had
cancelled what else he owed, how easy virtue would henceforth
be!</p>
<p>It had not been easy at the date of his first marriage.&nbsp;
He was deeply in debt, and out of favor with his father.&nbsp; It
was on both accounts that he went abroad for some months.&nbsp;
In Holland he married.&nbsp; His wife was Jan&rsquo;s mother, and
Jan was their only child.</p>
<p>Her people were of middle rank, leading quiet though
cultivated lives.&nbsp; Her mother was dead, and she was her old
father&rsquo;s only child.&nbsp; It would be doing injustice to
the kind of love with which she inspired her husband to dwell
much upon her beauty, though it was of that high type which takes
possession of the memory for ever.&nbsp; She was very intensely,
brilliantly fair, so that in a crowd her face shone out like a
star.&nbsp; Time never dimmed one golden thread in her hair; and
Death, who had done so much for Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client, could
not wash that face from his brain.&nbsp; It blotted the traffic
out of the streets, and in their place Dutch pastures, whose rich
green levels were unbroken by hedge or wall, stretched flatly to
the horizon.&nbsp; It bent over a drawing on his knee as he and
she sat sketching together in an old-world orchard, where the
trees bore more moss than fruit.&nbsp; The din of London was
absolutely unheard by Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client, but he heard her
voice, saying, &ldquo;You must learn to paint cattle, if you mean
to make any thing of Dutch scenery.&nbsp; And also, where the
earth gives so little variety, one must study the sky.&nbsp; We
have no mountains, but we have clouds.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in the
orchard, under the apple-tree, across the sketch-book, that they
had plighted their troth&mdash;ten years ago.</p>
<p>They were married.&nbsp; Had he ever denied himself a single
gratification, because it would add another knot to the tangle of
his career?&nbsp; He had pacified creditors by incurring fresh
debts, and had evaded catastrophes by involving himself in new
complications all his life.&nbsp; His marriage was accomplished
at the expense of a train of falsehoods, but his father-in-law
was an unworldly old man, not difficult to deceive.&nbsp; He
spent most of the next ten months in Holland, and, apart from his
anxieties, it was the purest, happiest time he had ever
known.&nbsp; Then his father recalled him peremptorily to
England.</p>
<p>When Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client obeyed his father&rsquo;s
summons, the climax of his difficulties seemed at hand.&nbsp; The
old man was anxious for a reconciliation, but resolved that his
son should &ldquo;settle in life;&rdquo; and he had found a wife
for him, the daughter of a Scotch nobleman, young, handsome, and
with a good fortune.&nbsp; He gave him a fortnight for
consideration.&nbsp; If he complied, the old man promised to pay
his debts, to make him a liberal allowance, and to be in every
way indulgent.&nbsp; If he thwarted his plans, he threatened to
allow him nothing during his lifetime, and to leave him nothing
that he could avoid bequeathing at his death.</p>
<p>It was at this juncture that Jan&rsquo;s mother followed her
husband to England.&nbsp; Her anxieties were not silenced by
excuses which satisfied her father.&nbsp; The crisis could hardly
have been worse.&nbsp; Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client felt that
confession was now inevitable; and that he could confess more
easily by letter when he reached London.&nbsp; But before the
letter was written, his wife died.</p>
<p>Weak men, harassed by personal anxieties, become hard in
proportion to their selfish fears.&nbsp; It is like the cruelty
that comes of terror.&nbsp; He had loved his wife; but he was
terribly pressed, and there came a sense of relief even with the
bitterness of the knowledge that he was free.&nbsp; He took the
body to Holland, to be buried under the shadow of the little
wooden church where they were married; and to the desolate old
father he promised to bring his grandson&mdash;Jan.&nbsp; But
just after the death of an old nurse, in whose care he had placed
his child, another crisis came to Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client.&nbsp;
On the same day he got letters from his father and from his
father-in-law.&nbsp; From the first, to press his instant return
home; from the second, to say that, if he could not at once bring
Jan, the old man would make the effort of a voyage to England to
fetch him.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s father almost hated him.&nbsp; That
the child should have lived when the beloved mother died was in
itself an offence.&nbsp; But that that freedom, and peace, and
prosperity, which were so dearly purchased by her death, should
be risked afresh by him, was irritating to a degree.&nbsp; He was
frantic.&nbsp; It was impossible to fail that very peremptory old
gentleman, his father.&nbsp; It was out of the question to allow
his father-in-law to come to England.&nbsp; He could not throw
away all his prospects.&nbsp; And the more he thought of it, the
more certain it seemed that Jan&rsquo;s existence would for ever
tie him to Holland; that for his grandson&rsquo;s sake the old
man would investigate his affairs, and that the truth would come
out sooner or later.&nbsp; The very devil suggested to him that
if the child had died with its mother he would have been quite
free, and intercourse with Holland would have died away
naturally.&nbsp; He wished to forget.&nbsp; To a nature of his
type, when even such a love as he had been privileged to enjoy
had become a memory involving pain, it was instinctively evaded
like any other unpleasant thing.&nbsp; He resolved, at last, to
let nothing stand between him and reconciliation with his
father.&nbsp; Once more he must desperately mortgage the future
for present emergencies.&nbsp; He wrote to the old father-in-law
to say that the child was dead.&nbsp; He excused this to himself
on the ground of Jan&rsquo;s welfare.&nbsp; If the truth became
fully known, and his father threw him off, he would be a poor
embarrassed man, and could do little for his child.&nbsp; But
with his father&rsquo;s fortune, and, perhaps, the Scotch
lady&rsquo;s fortune, it would be in his power to give Jan a
brilliant future, <i>even if</i> he never fully acknowledged
him.&nbsp; As yet he hardly recognized such an unnatural
possibility.&nbsp; He said to himself, that when he was free, all
would be well, and the Dutch grandfather would forgive the lie in
the joy of discovering that Jan was alive, and would be so well
provided for.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client was reconciled to his father.&nbsp; He
married Lady Adelaide, and announced the marriage to his
father-in-law.&nbsp; After which, his intercourse with Holland
died out.</p>
<p>It was a curious result of a marriage so made that it was a
very happy one.&nbsp; Still more curious was the likeness, both
physical and mental, between the second wife and the first.&nbsp;
Lady Adelaide was half Scotch and half English, a blonde of the
most brilliant type, and of an intellectual order of
beauty.&nbsp; But fair women are common enough.&nbsp; It was
stranger still that the best affections of two women of so high a
moral and intellectual standard should have been devoted to the
same and to such a husband.&nbsp; Not quite in vain.&nbsp;
Indeed, but for that grievous sin towards his eldest son, Mr.
Ford&rsquo;s client would probably have become an utterly
different man.&nbsp; But there is no rising far in the moral
atmosphere with a wilful, unrepented sin as a clog.&nbsp; It was
a miserable result of the weakness of his character that he could
not see that the very nobleness of Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s should
have encouraged him to confess to her what he dared not trust to
his father&rsquo;s imperious, petulant affection.&nbsp; But he
was afraid of her.&nbsp; It had been the same with his first
wife.&nbsp; He had dreaded that she should discover his
falsehoods far more than he had feared his father-in-law.&nbsp;
And years of happy companionship made it even less tolerable to
him to think of lowering himself in Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s
regard.</p>
<p>But there was a far more overwhelming consideration which had
been gathering strength for eight years between him and the idea
of recognizing Jan as his eldest son, and his heir.&nbsp; He had
another son, Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s only child.&nbsp; If he had
hesitated when the boy was only a baby to tell her that her
darling was not his only son, it was less and less easy to him to
think of bringing Jan,&mdash;of whom he knew nothing&mdash;from
the rough life of the mill to supplant Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s
child, when the boy grew more charming as every year went
by.&nbsp; Clever, sweet-tempered, of aristocratic appearance,
idolized by the relatives of both his parents, he seemed made by
Providence to do credit to the position to which he was believed
to have been born.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client had almost made the resolve against
which that fair face that was not Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s for ever
rose up in judgment: he was just deciding to put Jan to school,
and to give up all idea of taking him home, when death seemed
once more to have solved his difficulties.&nbsp; An unwonted ease
came into his heart.&nbsp; Surely Heaven, knowing how sincerely
he wished to be good, was making goodness easy to him,&mdash;was
permitting him to settle with his conscience on cheaper terms
than those of repentance and restitution.&nbsp; (And indeed, if
amendment, of the weak as well as of the strong, be <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> great purpose for us, who shall
say that the ruggedness of the narrow road is not often smoothed
for stumbling feet?)&nbsp; The fever seemed quite providential,
and Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client felt quite pious about it.&nbsp; He
was conscious of no mockery in dwelling to himself on the thought
that Jan was &ldquo;better off&rdquo; in Paradise with his
mother.&nbsp; And he himself was safe&mdash;for the first time
since he could remember,&mdash;free at last to become worthier,
with no black shadow at his heels.&nbsp; Very touching was his
resolve that he would be a better father to his son than his own
father had been to him.&nbsp; If he could not train him in high
principles and self-restraint, he would at least be indulgent to
the consequences of his own indulgence, and never drive him to
those fearful straits.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll be a very
different young man from what I was,&rdquo; was his final
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks to his good mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mind was full of Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s goodness as he
entered his house, and she met him in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Edward!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I am so glad
you&rsquo;ve come home.&nbsp; I want you to see that quaint child
I was telling you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr.
Ford&rsquo;s client.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking very tired,&rdquo; said Lady
Adelaide, gently; &ldquo;but about the child.&nbsp; It is Lady
Louisa Ammaby&rsquo;s little girl.&nbsp; You know I met her just
before we left Brighton.&nbsp; I only saw the child once, but it
is the quaintest, most original little being!&nbsp; So unlike its
mother!&nbsp; She and her mother are in town, and they were going
out to luncheon to-day I found, so I asked the child here to dine
with D&rsquo;Arcy.&nbsp; Her <i>bonne</i> is taking off her
things, and I must go and bring her down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Lady Adelaide went out, her son came in, and rushed up to
his father.&nbsp; If Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client had failed in
natural affection for one son, his love for the other had a
double intensity.&nbsp; He put his arm tenderly round him, whilst
the boy told some long childish story, which was not finished
when Lady Adelaide returned, leading Amabel by the hand.&nbsp;
Amabel was a good deal taller.&nbsp; Her large feet were adorned
with ornamental thread socks, and leathern shoes buttoned round
the ankle.&nbsp; Her hair was cropped, because Lady Craikshaw
said this made it grow.&nbsp; She wore a big pinafore by the same
authority, in spite of which she carried herself with an
admirable dignity.&nbsp; The same candor, good sense, and
resolution shone from her clear eyes and fat cheeks as of
old.&nbsp; Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client was alarming to children, but
Amabel shook hands courageously with him.</p>
<p>She was accustomed to exercise courage in her behavior.&nbsp;
From her earliest days a standard of manners had been expected of
her beyond her age.&nbsp; It was a consequence of her
growth.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite a big girl now,&rdquo;
was a nursery reproach addressed to her at least two years before
the time, and she tried valiantly to live up to her inches.</p>
<p>But when Amabel saw D&rsquo;Arcy, she started and stopped
short.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you shake hands with my boy,
Amabel?&rdquo; said Lady Adelaide.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you must make
friends with him, and he&rsquo;ll give you a ride on the
rocking-horse after dinner.&nbsp; Surely such a big girl
can&rsquo;t be shy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goaded by the old reproach, Amabel made an effort, and,
advancing by herself, held out her hand, and said, &ldquo;How do
you do, Bogy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s black eyes twinkled with merriment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How do you do, Mother Bunch?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My <i>dear</i> D&rsquo;Arcy!&rdquo; said Lady Adelaide,
reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, I am not rude.&nbsp; I am only joking.&nbsp; She
calls me Bogy, so I call her Mother Bunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> Mother Bunch,&rdquo; said
Amabel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not Bogy,&rdquo; retorted
D&rsquo;Arcy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are,&rdquo; said Amabel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only you
had very old clothes on in the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Craikshaw had cruelly warned Lady Adelaide that Amabel
sometimes told stories, and, thinking that the child was
romancing, Lady Adelaide tried to change the subject.&nbsp; But
D&rsquo;Arcy cried, &ldquo;Oh, do let her talk, mamma.&nbsp; I do
so like her.&nbsp; She is such fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to laugh at me,&rdquo; said poor
Amabel, as D&rsquo;Arcy took her into the dining-room, &ldquo;I
gave you my paint-box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s stare of amazement awoke a doubt in
Amabel&rsquo;s mind of his identity with the Bogy of the
woods.&nbsp; Between constantly peeping at him, and her anxiety
to conduct herself conformably to her size in the etiquette of
the dinner-table, she did not eat much.&nbsp; When dinner was
over, and D&rsquo;Arcy led her away to the rocking horse, he
asked, &ldquo;Do you still think I&rsquo;m Bogy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no,&rdquo; said Amabel, &ldquo;I think perhaps
you&rsquo;re not.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re very like him, though
you talk differently.&nbsp; Do you make pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Arcy shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even of leaves?&rdquo; said Amabel.</p>
<p>When she was going away, D&rsquo;Arcy asked, &ldquo;Which do
you like best, me or Bogy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amabel pondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like you very much.&nbsp; You
made the rocking-horse go so fast; but I liked Bogy.&nbsp; He
carried me all up the hill, and he picked up my moss.&nbsp; I
wasn&rsquo;t afraid of him.&nbsp; I gave him a kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, give me a kiss,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arcy.&nbsp;
But there was a tone of raillery in his voice which put Amabel on
her dignity, and she shook her head, and began to go down the
steps of the house, one leg at a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m Bogy, you know, you <i>have</i> kissed me
<i>once</i>,&rdquo; shouted D&rsquo;Arcy.&nbsp; But
Amabel&rsquo;s wits were as well developed as her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once is enough for bogies,&rdquo; said she, and went
sturdily away.</p>

home.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s not got Abel now; but it&rsquo;s my
mother that mostly wants me.&nbsp; I be bothered about mother,
somehow,&rdquo; said Jan, with an anxious look.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
do forget things so, and be so queer.&nbsp; She left the beer-tap
running yesterday, and near two gallons of ale ran out; and this
morning she put the kettle on, and no water in it.&nbsp; And she
do cry terrible,&rdquo; Jan added, breaking down himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But Abel says to me the day he was took ill,
&lsquo;Janny,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;look to mother.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And so I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good lad, Jan,&rdquo; said the
schoolmaster.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit ye down and get your tea, and
I&rsquo;ll come back with ye to the mill.&nbsp; A bit of company
does folk good that&rsquo;s beside themselves with
fretting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the windmiller&rsquo;s wife was beyond such simple
cure.&nbsp; The overtasked brain was giving way, and though there
were from time to time such capricious changes in her condition
as led Jan to hope she was better, she became more and more
imbecile to the end of her life.</p>
<p>To say that he was a devoted son is to give a very vague idea
of his life at this time to those for whom filial duty takes the
shape of compliance rather than of action, or to those who have
no experience of domestic attendance on the infirm both of body
and of mind.</p>
<p>It was not in moments of tender feeling, or at his prayers, or
by Abel&rsquo;s grave, that Jan recalled his
foster-brother&rsquo;s dying charge; but as he emptied slops,
cleaned grates, or fastened Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s black dress
behind.&nbsp; Nor did gratitude flatter his zeal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Boys do be so ackered with hooks and eyes,&rdquo; the poor
woman grumbled in her fretfulness, and then she sat down to
bemoan herself that she had not a daughter left.&nbsp; She had
got a trick of stopping short half way through her dressing, and
giving herself up to tears, which led to Jan&rsquo;s assisting at
her toilette.&nbsp; He was soon expert enough with hooks and
eyes, the more tedious matter was getting up her courage, which
invariably failed her at the stage of her linsey-woolsey
petticoat.&nbsp; But when Jan had hooked her up, and tied her
apron on, and put a little shawl about her shoulders, and got her
close-fitting cap set straight,&mdash;a matter about as easy as
putting another man&rsquo;s spectacles on his nose,&mdash;and
seated her by the fire, the worst was over.&nbsp; Mrs. Lake
always cheered up after breakfast, and Jan always to the very end
hoped that this was the beginning of her getting better.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Even after a niece of the windmiller&rsquo;s came to live at
the mill, and to wait on Mrs. Lake, the poor woman was never
really content without Jan.&nbsp; As time went on, she wept less,
but her faculties became more clouded.&nbsp; She had some
brighter hours, and the company of the schoolmaster gave her
pleasure, and seemed to do her good.&nbsp; When the Rector
visited her, his very sympathy made him delicate about dwelling
on her bereavement.&nbsp; When the poor woman sobbed, he changed
the subject in haste, and his condolences were of a very general
character.&nbsp; But Master Swift had no such scruples; and as he
sat by her chair, with a kindly hand on hers, he spoke both
plainly and loudly.&nbsp; The latter because Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s
hearing had become dull.&nbsp; Nor did he cease to speak because
tears dropped perpetually from the eyes which were turned to him,
and which seemed day by day to lose color from the pupils, and to
grow redder round the lids from weeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them that sleep in Jesus shall <span
class="smcap">God</span> bring with Him.&nbsp; Ah! Mrs. Lake,
ma&rsquo;am, they&rsquo;re grand words for you and me.&nbsp; The
Lord has dealt hardly with us, but there are folk that lose their
children when it&rsquo;s worse.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many a
Christian parent has lived to see them grow up to wickedness, and
has lost &rsquo;em in their sins, and has had to carry
<i>that</i> weight in his heart besides their loss, that the
Lord&rsquo;s counsels for them were dark to him.&nbsp; But for
yours and mine, woman, that have gone home in their innocence,
what have we to say to the Almighty, except to pray of Him to
make us fitter to take them when He brings them back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the cloud that hung over the poor woman&rsquo;s
spirit, Master Swift&rsquo;s plain consolations made their
way.&nbsp; The ruling thought of his mind became the one idea to
which her unhinged intellect clung,&mdash;the second coming of
the Lord.&nbsp; For this she watched&mdash;not merely in the
sense of a readiness for judgment, but&mdash;out of the upper
windows of the windmill, from which could be seen a vast extent
of that heaven in which the sign of the Son of Man should be,
before He came.</p>
<p>Sky-gazing was an old habit with Jan, and his active
imagination was not slow to follow his foster-mother&rsquo;s
fancies.&nbsp; The niece did all the house-work, for the freakish
state of Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s memory made her help too uncertain to
be trusted to.&nbsp; But, with a restlessness which was perhaps
part of her disease, she wandered from story to story of the
windmill, guided by Jan, and the windmiller made no
objection.</p>
<p>The country folk who brought grist to the mill would strain
their ears with a sense of awe to catch Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s
mutterings as she glided hither and thither with that mysterious
shadow on her spirit, and the miller himself paid a respect to
her intellect now it was shattered which he had not paid whilst
it was whole.&nbsp; Indeed he was very kind to her, and every
Sunday he led her tenderly to church, where the music soothed her
as it soothed Saul of old.&nbsp; As the brain failed, she became
happier, but her sorrow was like a pain numbed by narcotics; it
awoke again from time to time.&nbsp; She would fancy the children
were with her, and then suddenly arouse to the fact that they
were not, and moan that she had lost all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;ve got one left, mother dear,&rdquo; Jan
would cry, and his caresses comforted her.&nbsp; But at times she
was troubled by an imperfect remembrance of Jan&rsquo;s history,
and, with some echo of her old reluctance to adopt him, she would
wail that she &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t want a stranger
child.&rdquo;&nbsp; It cut Jan to the heart.&nbsp; Ever since he
had known that he was not a miller&rsquo;s son, he had protested
against the knowledge.&nbsp; He loved the windmill and the
windmiller&rsquo;s trade.&nbsp; He loved his foster-parents, and
desired no others.&nbsp; He had a miller&rsquo;s thumb, and he
flattened it with double pains now that his right to it was
disputed.&nbsp; He would press Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s thin fingers
against it in proof that he belonged to her, and the simple wile
was successful, for she would smile and say, &ldquo;Ay, ay,
love!&nbsp; Thee&rsquo;s a miller&rsquo;s boy, for thee&rsquo;ve
got the miller&rsquo;s thumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three causes combined to strengthen Jan&rsquo;s love
for his home.&nbsp; His revolt from the fact that he was no
windmiller born gave the energy of contradiction.&nbsp; Then to
fulfil Abel&rsquo;s behests, and to take his place in the mill,
was now Jan&rsquo;s chief ambition.&nbsp; And whence could be
seen such glorious views as from the windows of a windmill?</p>
<p>Master Lake was very glad of his help.&nbsp; The quarterly
payment had now been due for some weeks, but, in telling the
schoolmaster, he only said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be as well pleased
if they forgot un altogether, now.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want him
took away, no time.&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ve lost Abel,
Jan&rsquo;ll have the mill after me.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a good son
is Jan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as he echoed Jan&rsquo;s praises, it never dawned on
Master Swift that he was the cause of the allowance having
stopped.&nbsp; Jan was jealous of his title as Master
Lake&rsquo;s son, but the schoolmaster dwelt much in his own mind
on the fact that Jan was no real child of the district; partly in
his ambition for him, and partly out of a dim hope that he would
himself be some day allowed to adopt him.&nbsp; In stating that
the windmiller had lost all his children by the fever, he had
stated the bare fact in all good faith; and as neither he nor the
Rector guessed the real drift of Mr. Ford&rsquo;s letter, the
mistake was never corrected.</p>
<p>Jan was useful in the mill.&nbsp; He swept the round-house,
coupled the sacks, received grist from the grist-bringers, and
took payment for the grinding in money or in kind, according to
custom.&nbsp; The old women who toddled in with their bags of
gleaned corn looked very kindly on him, and would say,
&ldquo;Thee be a good bwoy, sartinly, Jan, and the Lard&rsquo;ll
reward thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the windmiller came towards one of
these dames, she would say, &ldquo;Aal right, Master Lake, I be
in no manners of hurry, Jan&rsquo;ll do for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
when Jan came, his business-like method justified her
confidence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good day, mother,&rdquo; he would
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will ye pay, or toll it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bless ye, dear love, how should I pay?&rdquo; the old
woman would reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll toll it, Jan, and
thank ye kindly.&rdquo;&nbsp; On which Jan would dip the wooden
bowl or tolling-dish into the sack, and the corn it brought up
was the established rate of payment for grinding the rest.</p>
<p>But, though he constantly assured the schoolmaster that he
meant to be a windmiller, Jan did not neglect his special
gift.&nbsp; He got up with many a dawn to paint the
sunrise.&nbsp; In still summer afternoons, when the mill-sails
were idle, and Mrs. Lake was dozing from the heat, he betook
himself to the water-meads to sketch.&nbsp; In the mill itself he
made countless studies.&nbsp; Not only of the ever-changing
heavens, and of the monotonous sweeps of the great plains, whose
aspect is more changeable than one might think, but studies on
the various floors of the mill, and in the roundhouse, where old
meal-bins and swollen sacks looked picturesque in the dim light
falling from above, in which also the circular stones, the shaft,
and the very hoppers, became effective subjects for the
Cumberland lead-pencils.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the summer following the fever, Mrs. Lake
failed rapidly.&nbsp; She sat out of doors most of the day, the
miller moving her chair from one side to another of the mill to
get the shade.&nbsp; Master Swift brought her big nosegays from
his garden, at which she would smell for hours, as if the scent
soothed her.&nbsp; She spoke very little, but she watched the sky
constantly.</p>
<p>One evening there was a gorgeous sunset.&nbsp; In all its
splendor, with a countless multitude of little clouds about it
bright with its light, the glory of the sun seemed little less
than that of the Lord Himself, coming with ten thousand of His
saints, and the poor woman gazed as if her withered, wistful eyes
could see her children among the radiant host.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do
think the Lord be coming to-night, Master Swift,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And He&rsquo;ll bring them with
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gazed on after all the glory had faded, and lingered till
it grew dark, and the schoolmaster had gone home.&nbsp; It was
not till her dress was quite wet with dew that Jan insisted upon
her going indoors.</p>
<p>They were coming round the mill in the dusk, when a cry broke
from Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s lips; which was only an echo of a louder
one from Jan.&nbsp; A woman creeping round the mill in the
opposite direction had just craned her neck forward so that Jan
and his foster-mother saw her face for an instant before it
disappeared.&nbsp; Why Jan was so terrified, he would have been
puzzled to say, for the woman was not hideous, though she had an
ugly mouth.&nbsp; But he was terrified, and none the less so from
a conviction that she was looking intently and intentionally at
him.&nbsp; When he got his foster-mother indoors, the miller was
disposed to think the affair was a fancy; but, as if the shock
had given a spur to her feeble senses, Mrs. Lake said in a loud
clear voice, &ldquo;Maester, it be the woman that brought our Jan
hither!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when the miller ran out, no one was to be seen.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">JAN&rsquo;S PROSPECTS
AND MASTER SWIFT&rsquo;S PLANS.&mdash;TEA AND MILTON.&mdash;NEW
PARENTS.&mdash;PARTING WITH RUFUS.&mdash;JAN IS
KIDNAPPED.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> shock seemed to give a last
jar to the frail state of Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s health, and the sleep
into which she fell that night passed into a state of
insensibility in which her sorely tried spirit was released
without pain.</p>
<p>It was said that the windmiller looked twice his age from
trouble.&nbsp; But his wan appearance may have been partly due to
the inroads of a lung disease, which comes to millers from
constantly inhaling the flour-dust.&nbsp; His cheeks grew hollow,
and his wasted hands displayed the windmiller&rsquo;s coat of
arms <a name="citation238"></a><a href="#footnote238"
class="citation">[238]</a> with painful distinctness.&nbsp; The
schoolmaster spent most of his evenings at the mill; but
sometimes Jan went to tea with him, and by Master Lake&rsquo;s
own desire he went to school once more.</p>
<p>Master Swift thought none the less of Jan&rsquo;s prospects
that it was useless to discuss them with Master Lake.&nbsp; All
his plans were founded on the belief that he himself would live
to train the boy to be a windmiller, whilst Master Swift&rsquo;s
had reference to the conviction that &ldquo;miller&rsquo;s
consumption&rdquo; would deprive Jan of his foster-father long
before he was old enough to succeed him.&nbsp; And had the miller
made his will?&nbsp; Master Swift made his, and left his few
savings to Jan.&nbsp; He could not help hoping for some turn of
Fortune&rsquo;s wheel which should give the lad to him for his
own.</p>
<p>Jan was not likely to lack friends.&nbsp; The Squire had heard
with amazement that Master Chuter&rsquo;s new sign was the work
of a child, and he offered to place him under proper instruction
to be trained as an artist.&nbsp; But, at the time that this
offer came, Jan was waiting on his foster mother, and he refused
to betray Abel&rsquo;s trust.&nbsp; The Rector also wished to
provide for him, but he was even more easily convinced that
Jan&rsquo;s present duty lay at home.&nbsp; Master Swift too
urged this in all good faith, but his personal love for Jan, and
the dread of parting with him, had an influence of which he was
hardly conscious.</p>
<p>One evening, a few weeks after Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s death, Jan
had tea, followed by poetry, with the schoolmaster.&nbsp; Master
Swift often recited at the windmill.&nbsp; The miller liked to
hear hymns his wife had liked, and a few patriotic and romantic
verses; but he yawned over Milton, and fell asleep under Keats,
so the schoolmaster reserved his favorites for Jan&rsquo;s ear
alone.</p>
<p>When tea was over, Jan sat on the rush-bottomed chair, with
his feet on Rufus, on that side of the hearth which faced the
window, and on the other side sat Master Swift, with the mongrel
lying by him, and he spouted from Milton.&nbsp; Jan, familiar
with many a sunrise, listened with parted lips of pleasure, as
the old man trolled forth,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Right against the eastern gate,<br />
Where the great sun begins his state,<br />
Robed in flames and amber light,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and with even more sympathy to the latter part of &lsquo;Il
Penseroso;&rsquo; and, as when this was ended he begged for yet
more, the old man began &lsquo;Lycidas.&rsquo;&nbsp; He knew most
of it by heart, and waving his hand, with his eyes fixed
expressively on Jan, he cried,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth
raise<br />
(That last infirmity of noble minds)<br />
To scorn delights, and live laborious days.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And tears filled his eyes, and made his voice husky, as he
went on,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But the fair guerdon when we hope to
find,<br />
And think to burst out into sudden blaze,<br />
Comes the blind Fury with the abhorred shears&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Master Swift stopped suddenly.&nbsp; Rufus was growling, and
Jan was white and rigid, with his eyes fixed on the window.</p>
<p>As in most North countrymen, there was in the schoolmaster an
ineradicable touch of superstition.&nbsp; He cursed the
&ldquo;unlucky&rdquo; poem, and flinging the book from him ran to
his favorite.&nbsp; As soon as Jan could speak, he gasped,
&ldquo;The woman that brought me to the mill!&rdquo;&nbsp; But
when Master Swift went to search the garden he could find no
one.</p>
<p>Remembering the former alarm, and that no one was to be seen
then, Master Swift came to the conclusion that in each case it
was a delusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a dear good lad, Jan,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but ye&rsquo;ve fagged yourself out.&nbsp; Take the dog
with ye to-morrow for company, and your sketch-book, and amuse
yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not expect ye at school.&nbsp; And get
away to your bed now.&nbsp; I told Master Lake I shouldn&rsquo;t
let ye away to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan went to bed, and next morning was up with the lark, and
with Rufus at his heels went off to a distant place, where from a
mound, where a smaller road crossed the highway to London, there
was a view which he wished to sketch under an early light.&nbsp;
As he drew near, he saw a small cart, at one side of which the
horse was feeding, and at the foot of the mound sat a woman with
a pedler&rsquo;s basket.</p>
<p>When Jan recognized her, it was too late to run away.&nbsp;
And whither could he have run?&nbsp; The four white roads gleamed
unsheltered over the plains; there was no place to hide in, and
not a soul in sight.</p>
<p>When the large-mouthed woman seized Jan in her arms, and
kissing him cried aloud, &ldquo;Here he is at last!&nbsp; My
child, my long lost child!&rdquo; the despair which sank into the
poor boy&rsquo;s heart made him speechless.&nbsp; Was it possible
that this woman was his mother?&nbsp; His foster-mother&rsquo;s
words tolled like a knell in his ears,&mdash;&ldquo;The woman
that brought our Jan hither.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the sound of
Sal&rsquo;s voice the hunchback appeared from behind the cart,
and his wife dragged Jan towards him, crying, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
our dear son! our pretty, clever little son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bean&rsquo;t your son!&rdquo; cried poor Jan,
desperately.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For a moment the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife seemed staggered; but
unluckily Jan added, &ldquo;She died last month,&rdquo; and it
was evident that he knew nothing of his real history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, them mill people, them false wretches!&rdquo;
screamed the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I been a paying &rsquo;em
for my precious child, all this time, for &rsquo;em to teach him
to deny his own mother!&nbsp; The brutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan&rsquo;s face and eyes blazed with passion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How dare you abuse my good father and mother!&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You</i> be the wretch,
and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>But at this, and the same moment, the Cheap Jack seized Jan
furiously by the throat, and Rufus sprang upon the
hunchback.&nbsp; The hunchback was in the greater danger, from
which only his wife&rsquo;s presence of mind saved him.&nbsp; She
shrieked to him to let Jan go, that he might call off the dog,
which the vindictive little Cheap Jack was loath to do.&nbsp; And
when Jan had got Rufus off, and was holding him by the collar,
the hunchback seized a hatchet with which he had been cutting
stakes, and rushed upon the dog.&nbsp; Jan put himself between
them, crying incoherently, &ldquo;Let him alone!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
not mine&mdash;he won&rsquo;t hurt you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll send him
home&mdash;I&rsquo;ll let un loose if ye don&rsquo;t;&rdquo; and
Sal held back her husband, and said, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll
behave civil, Jan, my dear, and as you should do to your poor
mother, you may send the dog home.&nbsp; And well for him too,
for John&rsquo;s a man that&rsquo;s not very particular what he
does to them that puts him out in a place like this where
there&rsquo;s no one to tell tales.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d chop him
limb from limb, as soon as not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan shuddered.&nbsp; There was no choice but to save
Rufus.&nbsp; He clung round the curly brown neck in one agonized
embrace, and then steadied his voice for an authoritative,
&ldquo;Home, Rufus!&rdquo; as he let him go.&nbsp; Rufus
hesitated, and looked dangerously at the hunchback, who lifted
the hatchet.&nbsp; Jan shouted angrily, &ldquo;Home,
Rufus!&rdquo; and Rufus obeyed.&nbsp; Twenty times, as his
familiar figure, with the plumy tail curled sideways, lessened
along the road, was Jan tempted to call him back to his
destruction; but he did not.&nbsp; Only when the brown speck was
fairly lost to sight, his utter friendlessness overwhelmed him,
and falling on his knees he besought the woman with tears to let
him go,&mdash;at least to tell Master Lake all about it.</p>
<p>The hunchback began to reply with angry oaths, but Sal made
signs to him to be silent, and said, &ldquo;It comes very hard to
me, Jan, to be treated this way by my only son, but, if
you&rsquo;ll be a good boy, I&rsquo;m willing to oblige you, and
we&rsquo;ll drive round by the mill to let you see your friends,
though it&rsquo;s out of the way too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan was profuse of thanks, and by the woman&rsquo;s desire he
sat down to share their breakfast.&nbsp; The hunchback examined
his sketch-book, and, as he laid it down again, he asked,
&ldquo;Did you ever make picters on stone, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I could get paper, I did, sir,&rdquo; said
Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But could you now?&nbsp; Could you make &rsquo;em on a
flat stone, like a paving-stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d any thing to draw with, I could,&rdquo;
said Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could draw on any thing, if I had
something in my hand to draw with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cheap Jack&rsquo;s face became brighter, and in a
mollified tone he said to his wife, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a prime
card for such a young un.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a rum thing,
too!&nbsp; A man I knowed was grand at screeving, but he said
himself he was nowheres on paper.&nbsp; He made fifteen to
eighteen shillin&rsquo; a week on a average,&rdquo; the hunchback
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve knowed him take two
pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever draw fish, my dear?&rdquo; he
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve
drawn pigs and dogs, and I be mostly able to draw any thing I
sees, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cheap Jack whistled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Profiles pays
well,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;but the tip is the Young
Prodigy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so pleased to see what a clever boy you
are, Jan,&rdquo; said Sal; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all, my
dear.&nbsp; Put the bridle on the horse, John, for we&rsquo;ve
got to go round by the mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst the Cheap Jack obeyed her, Sal poked in the cart, from
which she returned with three tumblers on a plate.&nbsp; She gave
one to her husband, took one herself, and gave the third to
Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to your health, love,&rdquo; said she;
&ldquo;drink to mine, Jan, and I&rsquo;ll be a good mother to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jan tasted, and put his glass down again,
choking.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so strong!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Cheap Jack looked furious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nice manners
they&rsquo;ve taught this brat of yours!&rdquo; he cried to
Sal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do ye think I&rsquo;m going to take my
&rsquo;oss a mile out of the road to take him to see his friends,
when he won&rsquo;t so much as drink our good healths?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I will, indeed I will, sir,&rdquo; cried Jan.&nbsp;
He had taken a good deal of medicine during his illness, and he
had learned the art of gulping.&nbsp; He emptied the little
tumbler into his mouth, and swallowed the contents at a gulp.</p>
<p>They choked him, but that was nothing.&nbsp; Then he felt as
if something seized him in the inside of every limb.&nbsp; After
he lost the power of moving, he could hear, and he heard the
Cheap Jack say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go in for the Young Prodigy;
genteel from the first; only, if we goes among the nobs, he may
be recognized.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a rum-looking beggar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go a drinking every penny he
earns,&rdquo; said Sal, pointedly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll soon get
enough in a common line to take us to Ameriky, and he&rsquo;ll be
safe enough there.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this Jan thought that he made
a most desperate struggle and remonstrance.&nbsp; But in reality
his lips never moved from their rigidity, and he only rolled his
head upon his shoulder.&nbsp; After which he remembered no
more.</p>

supposititious master, which Jan drew with a heart that ached as
if it must break.</p>
<p>It was growing dark, but the exhibition had been so successful
that day, and the crowd was still so large, that the hunchback
was loath to desist.&nbsp; At a sign from him, Jan put his
colored chalks into a little pouch in front of him, and drew in
powerful chiaroscuro with soft black chalk and whitening.&nbsp;
These sketches were visible for some time, and the interest of
the crowd did not abate.</p>
<p>Suddenly a flush came over Jan&rsquo;s wan cheeks.&nbsp; A
baker who had paused for a moment to look, and then passed on,
was singing as he went, and the song and the man&rsquo;s accent
were both familiar to Jan.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The swallow twitters on the barn,<br />
The rook is cawing on the tree,<br />
And in the wood the ring-dove coos&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peremptory tone of the question turned Jan&rsquo;s
attention from the song, which died away down the street, and
looking up he met a pair of eyes as black as his own, and Mr.
Ford&rsquo;s client repeated his question.&nbsp; On seeing that a
&ldquo;swell&rdquo; had paused to look, the Cheap Jack hurried to
Jan&rsquo;s side, and was in time to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Smith&rsquo;s his name, sir.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s slow
of speech, my lord, though very quick with his pencil.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s not many artists can beat him, though I says it
that shouldn&rsquo;t, being his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> his father?&rdquo; said the gentleman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is not much like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He favours his mother more, my lord,&rdquo; said the
Cheap Jack; &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s where he gets his talents
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one ever thought he got &rsquo;em from you, old
hump!&rdquo; said one of the spectators, and there was a roar of
laughter from the bystanders.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client still lingered, though the staring and
pushing of the rude crowd were annoying to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really belong to this man?&rdquo; he asked of
Jan, and Jan replied, trembling, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son doesn&rsquo;t look as if you treated him very
well,&rdquo; said the gentleman, turning to the Cheap Jack.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take that, and give him a good supper this evening.&nbsp;
He deserves it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Cheap Jack stooped for the half crown thrown to him,
Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client gave Jan some pence, saying, &ldquo;You
can keep these yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s face, with a
look of gratitude upon it, seemed to startle him afresh, but it
was getting dark, and the crowd was closing round him.&nbsp; Jan
had just entertained a wild thought of asking his protection,
when he was gone.</p>
<p>What the strange gentleman had said about his unlikeness to
the Cheap Jack, and also the thoughts awakened by hearing the old
song, gave new energy to a resolve to which Jan had previously
come.&nbsp; He had resolved to run away.</p>
<p>Since he awoke from the stupor of the draught which Sal had
given him at the cross-roads, and found himself utterly in the
power of the unscrupulous couple who pretended to be his parents,
his life had been miserable enough.&nbsp; They had never intended
to take him back to the mill, and, since they came to London and
he was quite at their mercy, they had made no pretence of
kindness.&nbsp; That they kept him constantly at work could
hardly be counted an evil, for his working hours were the only
ones with happiness in them, except when he dreamed of
home.&nbsp; Not the cold pavement chilling him through his ragged
clothes, not the strange staring and jesting of the rough crowds,
not even the hideous sense of the hunchback&rsquo;s vigilant
oversight of him, could destroy his pleasure in the sense of the
daily increasing powers of his fingers, in which genius seemed to
tremble to create.&nbsp; In the few weeks of his apprenticeship
to screeving, Jan had improved more quickly than he might have
done under such teaching as the Squire had been willing to
procure for the village genius.&nbsp; At the peril of floggings
from the Cheap Jack, too many of which had already scarred his
thin shoulders, he ransacked his brains for telling subjects, and
forced from his memory the lines which told most, and told most
quickly, of the pathetic look on Rufus&rsquo;s face, the anger,
pleasure, or playfulness of the mill cats.&nbsp; Perhaps none of
us know what might be forced, against our natural indolence, from
the fallow ground of our capabilities in many lines.&nbsp; The
spirit of a popular subject in the fewest possible strokes was
what Jan had to aim at for his daily bread, under peril of bodily
harm hour after hour, for day after day, and his hand gained a
cunning it might never otherwise have learned, and could never
unlearn now.</p>
<p>In other respects, his learning was altogether of evil.&nbsp;
Perhaps because they wished to reconcile him to his life, perhaps
because his innocent face and uncorrupted character were an
annoyance and reproach to the wicked couple, they encouraged Jan
to associate with the boys of their own and the neighboring
courts.</p>
<p>Many people are sorry to believe that there are a great many
wicked and depraved grown-up people in all large towns, whose
habits of vice are so firm, and whose moral natures are so loose,
that their reformation is practically almost hopeless.&nbsp; But
much fewer people realize the fact that thousands of little
children are actively, hideously vicious and degraded.&nbsp; And
yet it is better that this should be remembered than that, since,
though it is more painful, it is more hopeful.&nbsp; It is hard
to reform vicious children, but it is easier than to reform
vicious men and women.</p>
<p>Little boys and little girls of eight or nine or ten years
old, who are also drunkards, sweaters, thieves, gamblers, liars,
and vicious, made Jan a laughing-stock, because of his simple
childlike ways.&nbsp; They called him &ldquo;green;&rdquo; but,
when he made friends with them by drawing pictures for them, they
tried to teach him their own terrible lore.&nbsp; Once the Cheap
Jack gave Jan a penny to go with some other boys to a penny
theatre, or &ldquo;gaff.&rdquo;&nbsp; The depravity of the
entertainment was a light matter to the depravity of the children
by whom the place was crowded, and who had not so much lost as
never found shame.&nbsp; Jan was standing amongst them, when he
caught sight of a boy with a white head leaning over the gallery,
whose face had a curious accidental likeness to
Abel&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The expression was quite different, for this
one was partly imbecile, but there was just likeness enough to
recall the past with an unutterable pang.&nbsp; What would Abel
have said to see him there?&nbsp; Jan could not breathe in the
place.&nbsp; The others were engaged, and he fought his way
out.</p>
<p>What he had heard and seen rang in his ears and danced before
his eyes after he crept to bed, as the dawn broke over the
streets.&nbsp; But as if Abel himself had watched by his bedside
as he used to do, and kept evil visions away, it did not trouble
his dreams.&nbsp; He dreamed of the windmill, and of his
foster-mother; of the little wood, and of Master Swift and
Rufus.</p>
<p>After that night Jan had resolved that, whether Sal were his
mother or not, he would run away.&nbsp; In the strength of his
foster-brother&rsquo;s pious memory he would escape from this
evil life.&nbsp; He would beg his way back to the village, and to
the upright, godly old schoolmaster, or at least die in the
country on the road thither.&nbsp; He had not associated with the
ragamuffins of the court without learning a little of their
cunning; and he had waited impatiently for a chance of eluding
the watchfulness of the Cheap Jack.</p>
<p>But the sound of that song and the meeting with Mr.
Ford&rsquo;s client determined him to wait no longer, but to make
a desperate effort for freedom then and there.&nbsp; The Cheap
Jack was collecting the pence, and Jan had made a few bold black
strokes as a beginning of a new sketch, when he ran up to the
Cheap Jack and whispered, &ldquo;Get me a ha&rsquo;perth of
whitening, father, as fast as you can.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an
oil-shop yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Jan,&rdquo; said the hunchback.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Keep &rsquo;em together, my dear, meanwhile.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re doing prime, and you shall have a sausage for
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Cheap Jack waddled away for the whitening, Jan said to
the lockers-on, &ldquo;Keep your places, ladies and gentlemen,
till I return, and keep your eyes on the drawing, which is the
last of the series,&rdquo; and ran off down a narrow street, at
right angles to the oil-shop.</p>
<p>The crowd waited patiently for some moments.&nbsp; Then the
Cheap Jack hurried back with the whitening.&nbsp; But Jan
returned no more.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE BAKER.&mdash;ON AND
ON.&mdash;THE CHURCH BELL.&mdash;A DIGRESSION.&mdash;A FAMILIAR
HYMN.&mdash;THE BOYS&rsquo; HOME.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jan</span> stopped at last from lack of
breath to go on.&nbsp; His feet had been winged by terror, and he
looked back even now with fear to see the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
misshapen figure in pursuit.&nbsp; He had had no food for hours,
but the pence the dark gentleman had given him were in his chalk
pouch, and he turned into the first baker&rsquo;s shop he came to
to buy a penny loaf.&nbsp; It was a small shop, served by a
pleasant-faced man, who went up and down, humming, whistling, and
singing,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like tiny pipe of wheaten straw,<br />
The wren his little note doth swell,<br />
And every living thing that flies&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A penny loaf, please,&rdquo; said Jan, laying down the
money, and the man turned and said, &ldquo;Why, you be the boy
that draws on the pavement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Jan was silent.&nbsp; It presented itself to him
as a new difficulty, that he was likely to be recognized.&nbsp;
There was a flour barrel by the counter, and as he pondered he
began mechanically to sift the flour through his finger and
thumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be used to flour seemingly,&rdquo; said the baker,
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was &rsquo;ee ever in a mill? &rsquo;ee
seems to have a miller&rsquo;s thumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes Jan had told his story, and had learned, with
amazement and delight, that the baker had not only been a
windmiller&rsquo;s man, but had worked in Master Lake&rsquo;s
tower mill.&nbsp; He was, in fact, the man who had helped George
the very night that Jan arrived.&nbsp; But he confirmed the fact
that it was Sal who brought Jan, by his account of her, and he
seemed to think that she was probably his mother.&nbsp; He was
very kind.&nbsp; He refused to take payment for the loaf, and
went, humming, whistling, and singing, away to get Jan some bacon
to eat with it.</p>
<p>When he was alone, Jan&rsquo;s hand went back to the flour,
and he sifted and thought.&nbsp; The baker was kind, but he had
said that &ldquo;it was an ackerd thing for a boy to quarrel
with&rsquo;s parents.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jan felt that he expected him
to go home.&nbsp; Perhaps at this moment the baker had gone, with
the best intentions, to fetch the Cheap Jack, and bring about a
family reunion.&nbsp; Terror had become an abiding state of
Jan&rsquo;s mind, and it seized him afresh, like a palsy.&nbsp;
He left the penny on the counter, and shook the flour-dust from
his fingers, and, stealing with side glances of dread into the
street, he sped away once more.</p>
<p>He had no knowledge of localities.&nbsp; He ran &ldquo;on and
on,&rdquo; as people do in fairy tales.&nbsp; Sometimes he rested
on a doorstep, sometimes he hid in a shutter box or under an
archway.&nbsp; He had learned to avoid the police, and he moved
quickly from one dark corner to another with a hunted look in his
black eyes.&nbsp; Late in the night he found a heap of straw near
a warehouse, on which he lay down and fell asleep.&nbsp; At eight
o&rsquo;clock the next morning he was awakened by the clanging of
a bell, and he jumped up in time to avoid a porter who was coming
to the warehouse, and ran &ldquo;on and on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a bright morning, and the sun was shining; but
Jan&rsquo;s feet were sore, and his bones ached from cold and
weariness.&nbsp; Yesterday the struggle to escape the Cheap Jack
had kept him up, but now he could only feel his utter loneliness
and misery.&nbsp; There was not a friendly sound in all the
noises of the great city,&mdash;the street cries of food he could
not buy, the quarrelling, the laughter with which he had no
concern, the tramp of strange feet, the roar of traffic and
prosperity in which he had no part.</p>
<p>He was so lonely, so desolate, that when a sound came to him
which was familiar and pleasant, and full of old and good and
happy associations, it seemed to bring his sad life to a climax,
to give just one strain too much to his powers of
endurance.&nbsp; Like the white lights he put to his black
sketches, it seemed to bring the darkness of his life into
relief, and he felt as if he could bear no more, and would like
to sit down and die.&nbsp; The sound came through the porch of a
church.&nbsp; It was the singing of a hymn,&mdash;one of Charles
Wesley&rsquo;s hymns, of which Master Swift was so fond.</p>
<p>The sooty iron gates were open, and so was the door.&nbsp; Jan
crept in to peep, and he caught sight of a stained window full of
pale faces, which seemed to beckon him, and he went into the
church and no one molested him.</p>
<p>There is a very popular bit of what I venture to think a
partly false philosophy which comes up again and again in
magazines and story books in the shape of satirical contrasts
between the words of the General Confession, or the Litany, and
the particular materials in which the worshippers, the
intercessors, and the confessing sinners happen to be
clothed.&nbsp; But, since broadcloth has never yet been made
stout enough to keep temptation from the soul, and silk has
proved no protection against sorrow, I confess that I never could
see any thing more incongruous in the confessions and petitions
of handsomely dressed people than of ragged ones.&nbsp; That any
sinner can be &ldquo;miserable&rdquo; in satin, seems impossible,
or at least offensive, to some minds; perhaps to those who know
least of the reckless, callous light-heartedness of the most
ragged reprobates.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do, it seems to me, with the fact that a
certain degree of outlay on dress is criminal, on several grave
accounts; nor even with the incongruous spectacle of a becoming
bonnet arranged during the Litany by the tightly gloved fingers
of a worshipper, who would probably not be any the more devout
for being uncomfortably conscious of bad clothes.&nbsp; An old
friend of my childhood used to tell me that she always thought a
good deal of her dress before going to church, that she might
quite forget it when there.</p>
<p>Surely, dress has absolutely nothing to do with
devotion.&nbsp; And the impertinent patronage of worshippers in
&ldquo;fustian&rdquo; is at least as offensive as the
older-fashioned vulgarity of pride in congregations who
&ldquo;come in their own carriages.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I do protest
against the flippant inference that good clothes for the body
must lower the assumptions of the spirit, or make repentance
insincere; which I no more believe than that the worship of a
clean Christian is less acceptable than that of a brother who
cannot afford or does not value the use of soap.</p>
<p>I am perhaps anxious to defend this congregation, on which Jan
stumbled in the pale light of early morning in the city, from any
imputation on the sincerity of its worship, because it was mostly
very comfortably clad.&nbsp; The men were chiefly business men,
with a good deal of the obnoxious &ldquo;broadcloth&rdquo; about
them, and with well-brushed hats beneath their seats.&nbsp; One
of the stoutest and most comfortable-looking, with an intelligent
face and a fair clean complexion which spoke of good food, stood
near the door.&nbsp; He wore a new great-coat with a velvet
collar, but his gray eyes (they had seen middle age, and did not
shine with any flash of youthful enthusiasm) were fixed upon the
window, and he sang very heartily, and by heart,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Other Refuge have I none!<br />
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;<br />
Leave, ah! leave me not alone,<br />
Still support and comfort me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tears flowed down Jan&rsquo;s cheeks.&nbsp; It had been a
favorite hymn of his foster-mother, and he had often sung it to
her.&nbsp; Master Swift used to &ldquo;give the note,&rdquo; and
then sink himself into the bass part, and these quaint duets had
been common at the mill.&nbsp; How delightful such simple
pleasures seem to those who look back on them from the dark
places of the earth, full of misery and wickedness!</p>
<p>In spite of his tears, Jan was fain to join as the hymn went
on, and he sang like a bird,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All my trust on Thee is stayed,<br />
All my help from Thee I bring;<br />
Cover my defenceless head<br />
With the shadow of Thy wing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the hymn after the third collect, and when it was ended
the comfortable-looking gentleman motioned Jan into a seat, and
he knelt down.</p>
<p>When the service was over, the same gentleman took him by the
arm, and asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, my
boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rapid survey of his woes led Jan to reply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
no home, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The congregation had dispersed quickly, for the men were going
to business.</p>
<p>This gentleman walked fast, and he hurried Jan along with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are your parents?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; The
service had recalled Jan&rsquo;s highest associations, and he was
anxious to tell the strict truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know, sir,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; sobbed poor Jan.</p>
<p>They were stopping before a large house, and the gentleman
said, &ldquo;Look here, my boy.&nbsp; If you had a good home, and
good food, and clothes, would you work?&nbsp; Would you try to be
a good lad, and learn an honest trade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever worked?&nbsp; What can you do?&rdquo;
asked the gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can mind pigs; but I do think &rsquo;twould be best
for I to be in a mill, and I&rsquo;ve got a miller&rsquo;s
thumb.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jan said this because the idea had struck him
that if he could only get home again he might hire himself out at
a mop to Master Lake.&nbsp; A traditional belief in the force of
the law of hiring made him think that this would protect him
against any claim of the Cheap Jack.&nbsp; Before the gentleman
could reply, the house-door was opened by a boy some years older
than Jan, who was despatched to fetch &ldquo;the
master.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jan felt sure that it must be a school,
though he was puzzled by the contents of the room in which they
waited.&nbsp; It was filled with pretty specimens of
joiner&rsquo;s and cabinet-maker&rsquo;s work, some quite and
some partly finished.&nbsp; There were also brushes of various
kinds, so that, if there had been a suitable window, Jan would
have concluded that it was a shop.&nbsp; In two or three moments
the master&rsquo;s step sounded in the passage.</p>
<p>Jan had pleasant associations with the word
&ldquo;master,&rdquo; and he looked up with some vague fancy of
seeing a second Master Swift.&nbsp; Not that Master Swift, or any
one else in the slow-going little village, ever walked with this
sharp, hasty tread, as if one hoped to overtake time!&nbsp; With
such a step the gentleman himself went away, when he had said to
Jan, &ldquo;Be a good boy, my lad, and attend to your master, and
he&rsquo;ll be a good friend to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not in the least like Master Swift.&nbsp; He was young,
and youthfully dressed.&nbsp; A schoolmaster with neither
spectacles nor a black coat was a new idea to Jan; but he seemed
to be kind, for, with a sharp look at Jan&rsquo;s pinched face,
he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be glad of some breakfast, my lad, I
fancy; and breakfast&rsquo;s only just over.&nbsp; Come
along.&rdquo;&nbsp; And away he went at double quick time down
the passage, and Jan ran after him.</p>
<p>On their way to the kitchen, they crossed an open court where
boys were playing, and round which ran mottoes in large
letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can read?&rdquo; said the master, quickly, as he
caught Jan&rsquo;s eyes following the texts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have
you ever been to school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you write?&nbsp; What else have you
learned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan pondered his stock of accomplishments.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can
write, sir, and cipher.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve learned geography
and history, and Master Swift gave I lessons in mechanics, and I
be very fond of poetry and painting, and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>The master was painfully familiar with the inventive and
boastful powers of street boys.&nbsp; He pushed Jan before him
into the kitchen, saying smartly, but good-humoredly,
&ldquo;There, there!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t make up stories, my
boy.&nbsp; You must learn to speak the truth, if you come into
the Home.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t expect poets and painters,&rdquo;
he added, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you can chop wood, and learn
what you&rsquo;re taught, you&rsquo;ll do for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile stole over the face of a shrewd-looking lad who was
washing dishes at the table.&nbsp; Jan saw that he was not
believed, and his tears fell into the mug of cocoa, and on to the
bread which formed his breakfast.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE BUSINESS MAN AND
THE PAINTER.&mdash;PICTURES AND POT BOILERS.&mdash;CIMABUE AND
GIOTTO.&mdash;THE SALMON-COLORED OMNIBUS.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> business men were half way to
their business when the shadow of the sooty church still fell
upon one or two of the congregation who dispersed more slowly; a
few aged poor who lingered from infirmity as well as leisure; and
a man neither very old nor very poor, whose strong limbs did not
bear him away at a much quicker pace.&nbsp; His enjoyment of the
peculiar pleasures of an early walk was deliberate as well as
full, and bustle formed no necessary part of his trade.&nbsp; He
was a painter.</p>
<p>The business gentleman hurrying out of the Boys&rsquo; Home
stumbled against the painter, whom he knew, but whom just now he
would not have been sorry to avoid.&nbsp; The very next
salmon-colored omnibus that passed the end of the street would
only just enable him to be punctual if he could catch it, and the
painter, in his opinion, had &ldquo;no sense of the value of
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The painter, on the other hand, held as strong
a conviction that his friend&rsquo;s sense of the monetary value
of time was so exaggerated as to hinder his sense of many higher
things in this beautiful world.&nbsp; But they were fast friends
nevertheless, and with equal charity pitied each other
respectively for a slovenly and a slavish way of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend!&rdquo; cried the artist, seizing the
other by the elbow, &ldquo;you are just coming from where I was
thinking of going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Jan&rsquo;s
friend, shaking hands to release his elbow, &ldquo;the master
will be delighted, and&mdash;my time is not my own, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know well,&rdquo; said the artist, with a little
humorous malice.&nbsp; &ldquo;It belongs to others.&nbsp; That is
your benevolence.&nbsp; So&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; laughed the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a man of leisure like you.&nbsp; I must
catch the next salmon-colored omnibus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk with you to it, and talk as we
go.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t propose to run at your time of life,
and with your position in the city!&nbsp; Now tell me, my good
friend, the boys in your Home are the offscouring of the streets,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are mostly destitute lads, but they have never
been convicted of crime any more than yourself.&nbsp; It is the
fundamental distinction between our Home and other industrial
schools.&nbsp; Our effort is to save boys whom destitution has
<i>all but</i> made criminal.&nbsp; It is not a
reformatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, I know.&nbsp; But I was speaking of
their bodily condition only.&nbsp; I want a model, and should be
glad to get it without the nuisance of sketching in the
slums.&nbsp; Such a ragged, pinched, eager, and yet stupid child
as might sit homeless between the black walls of Newgate and the
churchyard of St. Sepulchre,&mdash;a waif of the richest and most
benevolent society in Christendom, for whom the alternative of
the churchyard would be the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the only one, I trust,&rdquo; said the business
gentleman, almost passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;I trust in <span
class="smcap">God</span>, not the only alternative.&nbsp; If I
have a hope, it is that of greater and more effective efforts
than hitherto to rescue the children of London from
crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the warmth of this outburst, he had permitted a
salmon-colored omnibus to escape him, but, being much too good a
man of business to waste time in regrets, he placed himself at a
convenient point for catching the next, and went on speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you have another picture in
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a <i>picture</i>&mdash;a <i>pot boiler</i>,&rdquo;
said the artist, testily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Low art&mdash;domestic
sentiment&mdash;cheap pathos.&nbsp; My <i>picture</i> no one
would look at, even if it were finished, and if I could bring
myself to part with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind, you give me the first refusal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of my <i>picture</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is, I mean your street boy.&nbsp; It is just
in my line.&nbsp; I delight in your things.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t
make it too pathetic, or my wife won&rsquo;t be able to bear it
in the drawing room.&nbsp; Your things always make her
cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the pot boiler,&rdquo; said the artist;
&ldquo;I really wish you&rsquo;d look at my picture, unfinished
as it is.&nbsp; I should like you to have it.&nbsp;
Anybody&rsquo;ll take the pot boiler.&nbsp; I want a model for
the picture too, and, oddly enough, a boy; but one you
can&rsquo;t provide me with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&nbsp; The subject you say is&rdquo;&mdash;said the
man of business, dreamily, as he strove at the same time to make
out if a distant omnibus were yellow or salmon-colored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cimabue finding the boy Giotto drawing on the
sand.&nbsp; Ah! my friend, can one realize that meeting?&nbsp;
Can one picture the generous glow with which the mature and
courtly artist recognized unconscious genius struggling under the
form of a shepherd lad,&mdash;yearning out of his great Italian
eyes over that glowing landscape whose beauties could not be
written in the sand?&nbsp; Will the golden age of the arts ever
return?&nbsp; We are hardly moving towards it, I fear.&nbsp; For
I have found a model for my Cimabue,&mdash;an artist too, and a
true one; but no boy Giotto!&nbsp; Still I should like you to see
it.&nbsp; I flatter myself the coloring&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salmon,&rdquo; said the man of business, briskly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought it was yellow.&nbsp; My dear
fellow&mdash;<i>Hi</i>!&mdash;take as many boys as you
like&mdash;<i>To the City</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conductor of the salmon-colored omnibus touched his bell,
and the painter was left alone.</p>

prescribed ablutions seemed both pleasant and familiar to the new
boy, and the superintendent of the wood-chopping department
expressed his opinion that Jan&rsquo;s intelligence and dexterity
were wasted among the fagots, and that his vocation was to be a
brushmaker at least, if not a joiner.</p>
<p>Of such trades as were open to him in the Home Jan inclined to
cabinet-making.&nbsp; It must be amusing to dab little bunches of
bristles so deftly into little holes with hot pitch as to produce
a hearth-brush, but as a life-work it does not satisfy
ambition.&nbsp; For boot-making he felt no fancy, and the
tailor&rsquo;s shop had a dash of corduroy and closeness in the
atmosphere not grateful to nostrils so long refreshed by the
breezes of the plains.&nbsp; But, when an elder boy led him into
the airy room of the cabinet-maker, Jan found a subject of
interest.&nbsp; The man was making a piece of furniture to order;
the boys had done the rough work, and he was finishing it.&nbsp;
It was a combination of shelves and cupboard, and was something
like an old oak cabinet which stood in Master Chuter&rsquo;s
parlor, and which, in Jan&rsquo;s opinion, was both handsomer and
more convenient than this.&nbsp; When the joiner, amused by the
keen gaze of Jan&rsquo;s black eyes, asked him good-naturedly
&ldquo;how he liked it,&rdquo; Jan expressed his opinion, to
illustrate which he involuntarily took up the fat pencil lying on
the bench, and made a sketch of Master Chuter&rsquo;s cabinet
upon a bit of wood.</p>
<p>News spreads with mysterious swiftness in all communities,
large and small.&nbsp; Before dinner-time, it was known
throughout the Home that the master joiner had applied for the
new boy as a pupil, and that he could draw with a black-lead
pencil, and set his betters to rights.</p>
<p>The master had passed through several phases of feeling over
Jan during that morning.&nbsp; His first impression had been
dispelled by Jan&rsquo;s orderly ways, and the absence of any
vagrant restlessness about him.&nbsp; The joiner&rsquo;s report
awoke a hope that he would become a star of the institution, but
as his acquirements came to the light, and he proved not merely
to have a good voice, but to have been in a choir, the
master&rsquo;s generous hopes received a check, and as the day
passed on he became more and more convinced that it was a case to
be &ldquo;restored to his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When two o&rsquo;clock came, and the boys were all out for
&ldquo;recreation,&rdquo; Jan had to endure some chaff on the
subject of his accomplishments.&nbsp; But the banter of London
street boys was familiar to him, and he took it in good
part.&nbsp; When they found him good-tempered, he was soon
popular, and they asked his history with friendly curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And vot sort of a mansion did you hang out in ven you
wos at home?&rdquo; inquired a little lad, whose rosy cheeks and
dancing eyes would have qualified him to sit as a model for the
hero of some little tale of rustic life and simplicity, but who
had graduated in the lowest lore of the streets so much before he
was properly able to walk that he was bandy-legged in
consequence.&nbsp; There must have been some blood in him that
was domestic and not vagrant in its currents, for he was as a
rule one of the steadiest and best-behaved boys in the
establishment.&nbsp; Only from time to time he burst out into
street slang of the strongest description, apparently as a relief
to his feelings.&nbsp; Happily for the cause it had at heart, the
Boys&rsquo; Home was guided by large-minded counsels, and if the
eyes of the master were as the eyes of Argus, they could also
wink on occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hout with it!&rdquo; said the
bow-legged boy, straddling before Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it wos
Buckingham Palace as you resided in, make a clean breast of it,
and hease your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee knows more of palaces than the likes of me.&nbsp;
Thee manners be so fine,&rdquo; said Jan; and the repartee drew a
roar of laughter, in which the bandy-legged boy joined.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve lived in a windmill,&rdquo; Jan added,
&ldquo;and that be more than thee&rsquo;ve done, I
fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the boys had seen windmills, and some had not; and
there was a strong tendency among the boys who had to give
exaggerated, not to say totally fictitious, descriptions of those
buildings to the boys who had not.&nbsp; There was a quick,
prevailing impression, however, that Jan&rsquo;s word could be
trusted, and he was appealed to.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take it off in a
picter,&rdquo; said the bandy-legged boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;We heered
as you took off a <i>sweet of furnitur</i> in the Master&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; Take off the windmill, if you lived in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a bit of chalk in Jan&rsquo;s pocket, and the
courtyard was paved.&nbsp; He knelt down, and the boys gathered
round him.&nbsp; They were sharp enough to be sympathetic, and
when he begged them to be quiet they kept a breathless silence,
which was broken only by the distant roar of London outside, and
by the Master&rsquo;s voice speaking in an adjoining passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly say, sir, that I <i>fear</i>, but I think
you&rsquo;ll find most of them look too hearty and comfortable
for your purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About Jan the silence was breathless.&nbsp; The bow-legged boy
literally laid his hand upon his mouth, and he had better have
laid it over his eyes, for they seemed in danger of falling out
of their sockets.</p>
<p>Jan covered his for a moment, and then looked upwards.&nbsp;
Back upon his sensitive memory rolled the past, like a returning
tide which sweeps every thing before it.&nbsp; Much clearer than
those roofs and chimney-stacks the windmill stood against the
sky, with arms outstretched as if to recall its truant son.&nbsp;
If he had needed it to draw from, it was there, plain
enough.&nbsp; But how should he need to see it, on whose heart
every line of it was written?&nbsp; He could have laid his hand
in the dark upon the bricks that were weather-stained into
fanciful landscapes upon its walls, and planted his feet on the
spot where the grass was most worn down about its base.</p>
<p>He drew with such power and rapidity that only some awe of the
look upon his face could have kept silence in the little crowd
whom he had forgotten.&nbsp; And when the last scrap of chalk had
crumbled, and he dragged his blackened finger over the foreground
till it bled, the voice which broke the silence was the voice of
a stranger, who stood with the master on the threshold of the
court-yard.</p>
<p>Never perhaps was more conveyed in one word than in that which
he spoke, though its meaning was known to himself
alone,&mdash;</p>

270</span>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;WITHOUT
CHARACTER?&rdquo;&mdash;THE WIDOW.&mdash;THE BOW-LEGGED BOY TAKES
SERVICE.&mdash;STUDIOS AND PAINTERS.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Manage</span> it as you
like,&rdquo; the artist had said to the master of the Boys&rsquo;
Home.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lend him, sell him, apprentice him, give him
to me,&mdash;whichever you prefer.&nbsp; Say I want a
boot-black&mdash;a clothes-brusher&mdash;a palette-setter&mdash;a
bound slave&mdash;or an adopted son, as you please.&nbsp; The boy
I must have: in what capacity I get him is nothing to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am bound to remind you, sir,&rdquo; said the master,
&ldquo;that he was picked up in the streets, and has had no
training, and earned no outfit from us.&nbsp; He comes to you
without clothes, without character&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without character?&rdquo; cried the artist.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heavens and earth!&nbsp; Did you ever study
physiognomy?&nbsp; Do you know any thing of faces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is part of my duty to know something of them,
sir,&rdquo; began the master, who was slightly nettled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, my friend, but send me
the boy, as soon as is consistent with your rules and
regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was Jan.&nbsp; The man of business gave his consent,
but he implored his &ldquo;impulsive friend,&rdquo; as he termed
the artist, not to ruin the lad by indulgence, but to keep him in
his proper place, and give him plenty to do.&nbsp; In conformity
with this sensible advice, Jan&rsquo;s first duties in his new
home were to clean the painter&rsquo;s boots when he could find
them, shake his velveteen coat when the pockets were empty, sweep
the studio, clean brushes, and go errands.&nbsp; The artist was
an old bachelor, infamously cheated by the rheumatic widow he had
paid to perform the domestic work of his rooms; and when this
afflicted lady gave warning on being asked for hot water at a
later hour than usual, Jan persuaded the artist to enforce her
departure, and took her place.&nbsp; So heavy is the iron weight
of custom&mdash;when it takes the form of an elderly and widowed
domestic to a single gentleman&mdash;that even Jan&rsquo;s
growing influence would not have secured her dismissal, had not
the artist had a particular reason for wishing the boy&rsquo;s
practical talents to be displayed.&nbsp; He suspected his
business friend of distrusting them because of Jan&rsquo;s
artistic genius, and he was proud to boast that he had never
known the comfort of clean rooms and well-cooked food till
&ldquo;the boy Giotto&rdquo; became his housekeeper.</p>
<p>The work was play to Jan after his slavery to the hunchback,
and on his happiness in living with a painter it is needless to
dwell.&nbsp; For a week or two, the artist was busy with his
&ldquo;pot boiler,&rdquo; and did not pay much attention to his
new apprentice, and Jan watched without disturbing him; so that
when he offered to set the painter&rsquo;s palette, his master
regarded his success as an inspiration of genius, rather than as
a result of habits of observation.</p>
<p>The painter, though clever and ambitious, and with a very pure
and very elegant taste, was no mighty genius himself.&nbsp; The
average of public taste in art is low enough, but in refusing his
&ldquo;high art&rdquo; pictures, and buying his domestic ones,
the public was not far wrong.&nbsp; It must be confessed that he
had also a vein of indolence in his nature, and Jan soon painted
most of the pot boilers.&nbsp; Another of his duties was to sit
as a model for the picture.&nbsp; The painter sketched him again
and again, and was never quite satisfied.&nbsp; What the vision
of the windmill had lit up in the depth of his black eyes could
not be recalled to order in the painter&rsquo;s studio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is,&rdquo; said the artist one day;
&ldquo;domestic servitude is taking the poetry out of you.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re getting fat, Giotto!&nbsp; Understand that from
henceforth I forbid you to black boots or grates, to brush, dust,
wash, cook, or whatever disturbs the peace or hinders the growth
of the soul.&nbsp; I must get the widow back!&rdquo; and the
painter heaved a deep sigh.</p>
<p>But Jan was resolute against the widow.&nbsp; He effected a
compromise.&nbsp; The bandy-legged boy from the Home was taken
into the painter&rsquo;s service, and Jan made himself
responsible for his good conduct.&nbsp; He began by warning his
vivacious friend that no freemasonry of common street-boyhood
could hinder the duty he owed to his master of protecting his
property and insuring his comfort, and that he must sooner tell
tales of his friend than have the painter wronged.&nbsp; To this
homily the bandy-legged boy listened with his red cheeks
artificially distended, and occasional murmurs of
&ldquo;Crikey!&rdquo; but he took service on these terms, and did
Jan no discredit.&nbsp; He was incorruptibly honest, and when
from time to time the street fever seized him, and he left his
work to play at post-leaping outside, Jan would quietly take his
place, and did not betray him.&nbsp; This kindness invariably
drew tears of penitence from the soft-hearted young vagrant, his
freaks grew rarer and rarer, and he finally became as steady as
he was quick-witted.</p>
<p>Jan&rsquo;s duties were now confined to the painting-room, and
he soon became familiar with the studios of other artists, where
his intelligent admiration of paintings which took his fancy, his
modesty, his willing good-nature, and his precocious talent made
him a general favorite.</p>
<p>He went regularly with his master to the early service in the
sooty little church, in the choir of which he was finally
enrolled.&nbsp; And the man of business kept a friendly eye on
him, and gave him many a piece of sensible and very practical
advice, to balance the evils of an artistic career.</p>
<p>With the Bohemianism of artist-life Jan was soon as familiar
as with the Bohemianism of the streets.&nbsp; A certain
old-fashioned gravity, which had always been amongst his
characteristics, helped him to preserve both his dignity and
modesty in a manner which gave the man of business great
satisfaction.&nbsp; He might easily have been spoiled, but he was
not.&nbsp; He answered respectfully to about a dozen names which
the vagrant fancy of the young painters bestowed upon him:
Jan-of-all-work&mdash;Jan Steen&mdash;The Flying
Dutchman&mdash;Crimson Lake&mdash;Madder Lake&mdash;and
Miller&rsquo;s Thumb.</p>
<p>But his master called him <span
class="smcap">Giotto</span>.</p>
<p>He was very happy, but the old home haunted him, and he longed
bitterly for some news of his foster-father and the
schoolmaster.&nbsp; Whilst the terror of the Cheap Jack was still
oppressing him, he had feared to open any communication with the
past, for fear the wretched couple who were supposed to be his
parents should discover and reclaim him.&nbsp; But as his nerves
recovered their tone, as the horrors of his life as a screever
faded into softer tints, as that boon of poor
humanity&mdash;forgetfulness&mdash;healed his wounds, and he
began to go about the streets without thinking of the hunchback
at every corner, he felt more and more inclined to risk any thing
to know how his old friends fared.&nbsp; There also grew upon him
a conviction that the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s story was false.&nbsp;
He knew enough of art now, and of the value of his own powers,
and of the struggle for livelihoods in London, to see that it had
been a very good speculation to kidnap him.&nbsp; He had serious
doubts whether the cart had been driven round by the mill, and
whether Master Lake had refused to let him be awakened from his
sleep, and had said it was, &ldquo;All right, and he hoped the
lad would do his duty to his good parents.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
remembered, too, the hunchback&rsquo;s words when he lay
speechless from the drugged liquor, and these raised a puzzling
question: Why should &ldquo;the nobs&rdquo; recognize him?&nbsp;
He had learned what <i>nobs</i> are.&nbsp; Spelt without a
&ldquo;k,&rdquo; they are grand people, and what had grand people
to do with Sal&rsquo;s son?</p>
<p>One cannot live without sympathy, and Jan confided the
complexities of his history to the bow-legged boy, and the
interest they awakened in this young gentleman could not but be
gratifying to his friend.&nbsp; He kept one eye closed during the
story, as if he saw the whole thing (<i>too</i> clearly) at a
glance.&nbsp; He broke the thread of Jan&rsquo;s narrative by
comments which had no obvious bearing on the facts, and, when it
was ended, be gave it as his opinion that certain penny romances
which he named were a joke to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my! what a pity we can&rsquo;t employ a
detective!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever knowed a young
projidy find his noble relations without a detective?&nbsp; But
never mind, Jan.&nbsp; I knows their ways.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m up to
their dodges.&nbsp; Fust of all, you makes up your mind deep down
in your inside, and then you says nothing to nobody, but follows
it up.&nbsp; Fol-lows it up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to follow,&rdquo; said Jan;
&ldquo;and how can I make up my mind, when I know
nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where it is,&rdquo; said his friend;
&ldquo;if you knowed every thing, wot &rsquo;ud be the use of
coming the detective tip, and making it up in your
inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bow-legged boy had made it up in his.&nbsp; He had decided
that Jan was a nobleman in disguise, and that his father was a
duke, or a &ldquo;jook,&rdquo; as he called him.&nbsp;
Jan&rsquo;s active imagination could not quite resist the
influence of this romance, and he lay awake at night patching
together the hunchback&rsquo;s reference to the nobs, and the
incredulous glance of the dark-eyed gentleman who had given him
the half pence, and who was certainly a nob himself.&nbsp; And
never did he leave the house on an errand for the painter that
the bow-legged boy did not burst forth, dish-cloth or dirty boots
in hand, from some unexpected quarter, and adjure him to
&ldquo;look out for the jook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a lovely afternoon when, by his friend&rsquo;s advice,
Jan betook himself to the Park, that the nobs might have that
opportunity of recognizing him which the wide-mouthed woman had
feared.&nbsp; He had washed his face very clean, and brushed his
old jacket with trembling hands, and the bow-legged boy had tied
a spotted scarf, that had been given to himself by a stableman in
the mews opposite, round Jan&rsquo;s neck in what he called
&ldquo;a gent&rsquo;s knot,&rdquo; and the poor child went to
seek his fate with a beating heart.</p>
<p>There were nobs enough.&nbsp; Round and round they came, in
all the monotony of a not very exhilarating amusement.&nbsp; The
crowd was so great that the carriages crawled rather than drove,
and Jan could see the people well.&nbsp; Many a lovely face, set
in a soft frame of delicate hue, caught his artistic eye, and he
watched for and recognized it again.&nbsp; But only a passing
glance of languid curiosity met his eager gaze in return.&nbsp;
Not a nob recognized him.&nbsp; But a policeman looked at him as
if he did, and Jan crept away.</p>
<p>When he got home, he found household matters at a standstill,
for the bow-legged boy had been tearfully employed in thinking
how Jan would despise his old friends when the &ldquo;jook&rdquo;
had acknowledged him, and he had become a nob.&nbsp; And as Jan
set matters to rights, he resolved that he would not go to the
Park again to look for relatives.</p>

277</span>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE MILLER&rsquo;S
LETTER.&mdash;A NEW POT BOILER SOLD.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jan</span> was very happy, and the brief
dream of the &ldquo;jook&rdquo; was over, but his heart clung to
his old home.&nbsp; If love and care, if tenderness in sickness
and teaching in health, are parental qualities, why should he
seek another parent than Master Swift?&nbsp; And had he not a
foster-father to whom he was bound by all those filial ties of
up-bringing from infancy, and of a common life, a common trade,
and common joys and sorrows in the past, such as could bind him
to no other father?</p>
<p>He begged a bit of paper from the painter, and wrote a letter
to Master Lake, which would have done more credit to the
schoolmaster&rsquo;s instructions had it been less blotted with
tears.&nbsp; He besought his foster-father not to betray him to
the Cheap Jack, and he inquired tenderly after the schoolmaster
and Rufus.</p>
<p>The windmiller was no great scholar, as was shown by his
reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Jan</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your welcome letter to hand, and I do hope, my dear
Jan, It finds you well as it leave me at present.&nbsp; I be
mortal bad with a cough, and your friends as searched everywhere,
and dragged every place for you, encluding the plains for twenty
mile round and down by the watermill.&nbsp; That Cheap John be no
more your vather nor mine, an e&rsquo;d better not show his dirty
vace yearabouts after all he stole.&nbsp; but your poor mother,
she was allus took in by him, but she said with her own mouth,
that woman be no more the child&rsquo;s mother, and never wos a
mother, and your mother knowed wots wot, poor zowl!&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;m glad, my dear Jan, you be doing well in a genteel line,
though I did hope you&rsquo;d take to the mill; but work is
slack, and I&rsquo;m not wot I wos, and I do miss Master
Swift.&nbsp; He had a stroke after you left, and confined to the
house, so I will conclude, my dear Jan, and go down and rejoice
his heart to hear you be alive.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d main like to see
you, Jan, my dear, and so for sartin would he and all enquiring
friends; and I am till deth your loving vather, or as good, and I
shan&rsquo;t grudge you if so be you finds a better.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Abel
Lake</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d main like to see your vace again,
Jan, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jan sobbed so bitterly in reading the postscript that, after
vain attempts to console him by chaff, the bow-legged boy wept
from sympathy.</p>
<p>As to the painter, the whole letter so caught his capricious
fancy that he was for ever questioning Jan as to the details of
his life in that out-of-the-world district where the purest
breath of heaven turned the sails of the windmill, and where the
miller took payment for his work &ldquo;in kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a wonderful spot, Giotto,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;and, if I were richer, just now we&rsquo;d go down
together, and paint sunsets, and see your friends.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he walked up and down the studio, revolving his new caprice,
whilst Jan tried to think if any thing were likely to bring money
into his master&rsquo;s pocket before long.&nbsp; Suddenly the
artist seized a sketch that was lying near, and, turning it over,
began one on the other side, questioning Jan as he drew.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do old country wives dress in down yonder?&mdash;What
did you wear in the mill?&mdash;Where does the light come from in
a round-house,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>Presently he flung it to Jan, and, in answer to the
boy&rsquo;s cry of admiration, growled, &ldquo;Ay, ay.&nbsp; You
must do what <i>you</i> can now, for every after-touch of mine
will spoil it.&nbsp; There are hundreds of men, Giotto, whose
sketches are good, and their paintings daubs.&nbsp; But it is
only the sketches of great men that sell.&nbsp; The public likes
canvas and linseed oil for its money, where small reputations are
concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sketch was of a peep into the round-house.&nbsp; Jan,
toll-dish in hand, with a quaint business gravity, was met by a
dame who was just raising her old back after letting down her
sack of gleanings, with garrulous good-humor in her blinking eyes
and withered face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chiaroscuro good,&rdquo; dictated the painter;
&ldquo;execution sketchy; coloring quiet, to be in keeping with
the place and subject, but pure.&nbsp; You know the scene better
than I, so work away, Giotto.&nbsp; Motto&mdash;&rsquo;Will ye
pay or toll it, mother?&rsquo;&nbsp; Price twenty-five
guineas.&nbsp; Take it to What&rsquo;s-his-name&rsquo;s, and if
it sells we&rsquo;ll go to Arcadia, Giotto mio!&nbsp; The very
thought of those breezes is as quinine to my languid
faculties!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan worked hard at the new &ldquo;pot boiler.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
artist painted the boy&rsquo;s figure himself, and Jan did most
of the rest.&nbsp; The bow-legged boy stooped in a petticoat as a
model for the old woman, murmuring at intervals, &ldquo;Oh, my,
here <i>is</i> a game!&rdquo; and, when the painter had left the
room, his grave speculations as to whether the withered face of
the dame were a good likeness of his own chubby cheeks made Jan
laugh till he could hardly hold his palette.&nbsp; It was done at
last, and Jan took it to the picture-dealer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The poor boy could hardly keep out of the street where the
picture-dealer lived.&nbsp; One afternoon, as he was hanging
about the window, the business gentleman came by and asked kindly
after his welfare.&nbsp; Jan was half ashamed of the hope with
which he told the tale of the pot boiler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you did some of it?&rdquo; said the business
gentleman, peering in through his spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the painting, sir, not the design,&rdquo; said
Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want very much to go and see your old
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>The business gentleman put his gold spectacles into their
case, and laid his hand on Jan&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am not much of a judge of genius,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but if
you have it, and if you live to make a fortune by it, remember,
my boy, that there is no luxury which money puts in a man&rsquo;s
power like the luxury of helping others.&rdquo;&nbsp; With which
he stepped briskly into the picture-dealer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And half an hour afterwards Jan burst into the painter&rsquo;s
studio, crying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sold, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sold!&rdquo; shouted the painter, in boyish glee.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hooray!&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s that rascal Bob?&nbsp; Oh, I
know!&nbsp; I sent him for the beer.&nbsp; Giotto, my dear
fellow, I have some shooting-boots somewhere, if you can find
them, and a tourist&rsquo;s knapsack, and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>But Jan had started to find the boots, and the bow-legged boy,
who had overheard the news as he left the house, rushed up the
street, with his head down, crying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sold!
it&rsquo;s sold!&rdquo; and, as he ran, he jostled against a man
in a white apron, carrying a pot of green paint to some area
railings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s sold?&rdquo; said he, testily, as he
recovered his balance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You a painter, and don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; said the
rosy-cheeked boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, my!&nbsp; Wot&rsquo;s
sold?&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;m sold, and <i>it&rsquo;s</i>
sold.&nbsp; That walable picter I wos about to purchase for my
mansion in Piccadilly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, feigning to burst into a
torrent of tears, he darted round the corner and into the
public-house.</p>
<h2><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">SUNSHINE AFTER
STORM.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had been a wet morning.&nbsp;
The heavy rain-clouds rolled over the plains, hanging on this
side above the horizon as if in an instant they must fall and
crush the solid earth, and passing away on that side in dark,
slanting veils of shower; giving to the vast monotony of the wide
field of view that strange interchange of light and shadow, gleam
and gloom, which makes the poetry of the plains.</p>
<p>The rain had passed.&nbsp; The gray mud of the chalk roads
dried up into white dust almost beneath the travellers&rsquo;
feet as they came out again after temporary shelter; and that
brightest, tenderest smile, with which, on such days, the sun
makes evening atonement for his absence, shone and sparkled,
danced and glowed from the windmill to the water-meads.&nbsp; It
reopened the flowers, and drew fragrant answer from the
meadow-sweet and the bay-leaved willow.&nbsp; It made the birds
sing, and the ploughboy whistle, and the old folk toddle into
their gardens to smell the herbs.&nbsp; It cherished silent
satisfaction on the bronze face of Rufus resting on his paws, and
lay over Master Swift&rsquo;s wan brow like the aureole of some
austere saint canonized, just on this side the gates of
Paradise.</p>
<p>The simile is not inapt, for the coarse and vigorous features
of the schoolmaster had been refined to that peculiar nobleness
which, perhaps, the sharp tool of suffering&mdash;used to its
highest ends&mdash;can alone produce.&nbsp; And the smile of
patience, like a victor&rsquo;s wreath, lay now where hot
passions and imperious temper had once struggled and been
overcome.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster was paralyzed in his lower limbs, and he sat
in a wheel-chair of his own devising, which he could propel with
his own hands.&nbsp; The agonizing anxiety and suspense which
followed Jan&rsquo;s disappearance had broken him down, and this
was the end.&nbsp; Rufus was still his only housekeeper, but a
woman from the village came in to give him necessary help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it be &rsquo;most like waiting upon a angel,&rdquo;
said she.</p>
<p>This woman had gone for the night, and Master Swift sat in his
invalid chair in the little porch, where he could touch the
convolvulus bells with his hand, and see what some old pupil of
his had done towards &ldquo;righting up&rdquo; the garden.&nbsp;
It was an instance of that hardly earned grace of patience in him
that he did not vex himself to see how sorely the garden suffered
by his helplessness.</p>
<p>Not without cause was the evening smile of sunlight reflected
on Master Swift&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; Between the fingers of a hand
lying on his lap lay Jan&rsquo;s letter to announce that he and
the artist were coming to the cottage, and in intervals of
reading and re-reading it the schoolmaster spouted poetry, and
Rufus wagged a sedately sympathetic tail.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How fresh, O Lord, how sweet and clean<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are Thy returns! even as the flowers in spring;<br
/>
To which, besides their own demean,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The late past frosts tributes of pleasure bring.<br
/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Grief melts away<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like snow in May,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if there were no such cold thing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, waving his hand after the old manner towards the glowing
water-meadows, he went on with increasing emphasis:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who would have thought my shrivelled
heart<br />
Could have recovered greennesse?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Rufus felt himself bound to answer what had a tone of
appeal in it, or perhaps some strange sympathy, not with Master
Swift, began already to disturb him.&nbsp; He rose and knocked up
the hand in which the letter lay with his long nose, and wandered
restlessly about, and then settled down again with his eyes
towards the garden-gate.</p>
<p>The old man sat still.&nbsp; The evening breeze stirred his
white hair, and he drank in the scents drawn freshly from field
and flowers after the rain, and they were like balm to him.&nbsp;
As he sat up, his voice seemed to recover its old power, and he
clasped his hands together over Jan&rsquo;s letter, and went
on:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And now in age I bud again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; After so many deaths I live and write;<br />
I once more smell the dew and rain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And relish versing: O my only Light!<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It cannot be<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That I am he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On whom Thy tempests fell all night!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far Mr. George Herbert; but the poem was never finished,
for Rufus jumped up with a cry, and after standing for a moment
with stiffened limbs, and muffled whines, as if he could not
believe his own glaring yellow eyes, he burst away with tenfold
impetus, and dragged, and tore, and pulled, and all but carried
Jan to the schoolmaster&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>And the painter walked away down the garden, and stood looking
long over the water-meadows.</p>

286</span>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">A PAINTER&rsquo;S
EDUCATION.&mdash;MASTER CHUTER&rsquo;S PORT.&mdash;A FAREWELL
FEAST.&mdash;THE SLEEP OF THE JUST.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">hope</span>, Jan,&rdquo; said
Master Swift, &ldquo;that the gentleman will overlook my want of
respect towards himself, in consideration of what it was to me to
see your face again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t distress me by speaking of it, Mr.
Swift,&rdquo; said the painter, taking his hand, and sitting down
beside him in the porch.</p>
<p>As he returned the artist&rsquo;s friendly grasp, the
schoolmaster scanned his face with some of the old
sharpness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I beg you to
forgive my freedom.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a rough man with a rough
tongue, which I could never teach to speak the feelings of my
heart; but I humbly thank you, sir, for your goodness to this
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very selfish kind of goodness at present,
Mr. Swift, and I fancy some day the obligation of the
acquaintance will be on my side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster, &ldquo;take Rufus
wi&rsquo; ye, and run that errand I telled ye.&nbsp;
Rufus&rsquo;ll carry your basket.&rdquo;&nbsp; When they had
gone, he turned earnestly to the painter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m speaking to ye out of my ignorance and
my anxiety.&nbsp; Ye want the lad to be a painter.&nbsp; Will he
be a great painter?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m reminding you of what
ye&rsquo;ll know better than me (though not by yourself, for Jan
tells me you&rsquo;re a grand artist), that a man may have the
ambition and the love, and some talent for an art, and yet be
just without that divine spark which the gods withhold.&nbsp;
Sir, <span class="smcap">God</span> forbid that I should
undervalue the pure pleasure of even that little gift; but
it&rsquo;s ill for a lad when he has just that much of an art to
keep him from a thrifty trade&mdash;and <i>no
more</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The painter replied as earnestly as Master Swift had
spoken,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan&rsquo;s estimate of me is weaker than his judgment
in art is wont to be.&nbsp; I speak to understanding ears, and
you will know that I have some true feeling for my art, when I
tell you that I know enough to know that I shall never be a great
painter; and it will help you to put confidence in my assurance
that, if he lives, <i>Jan will</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deep emotion kept the old man silent.&nbsp; It was a mixed
feeling,&mdash;first, intense pride and pleasure, and then a pang
of disappointment.&nbsp; Had he not been the first to see genius
in the child?&nbsp; Had he not built upon him one more ambition
for himself,&mdash;the ambition of training the future great
man?&nbsp; And now another had taken his office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look disappointed,&rdquo; said the artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the vile selfishness in me, sir.&nbsp; I had
hoped the boy&rsquo;s gifts would have been what I could have
trained at my own hearth.&nbsp; It is only one more wilful fancy,
once more thwarted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selfish I am sure it is not!&rdquo; said the painter,
hotly; &ldquo;and as to such benevolence being thwarted as a sort
of punishment for I don&rsquo;t know what, I believe nothing of
the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; said the old man,
firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m speaking of the
Lord&rsquo;s general dealings.&nbsp; There are tender, gentle
souls, I know well, who seem only to grow the purer and better
for having the desire of their eyes granted to them; but there
are others whom, for their own good, the Father of all sees
needful to chasten to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My experience lies in another direction,&rdquo; said
the painter, impetuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;With what awe do you
suppose indolent men, whose easy years of self-indulgent life
have been broken by no real calamity, look upon others on whose
heads blow falls after blow, though their existence is an hourly
struggle towards perfection?&nbsp; There are some stagnant pools
whose peace the Angel never disturbs.&nbsp; Does <span
class="smcap">God</span>, who takes pleasure in perfecting the
saint and pardoning the sinner, forget some of us because we are
not worth remembering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He forgets none of us, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the
schoolmaster, &ldquo;and He draws us to Himself at different
times, and by different roads.&nbsp; I wanted to be the
child&rsquo;s teacher, but He has chosen you, and will bless ye
in the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The painter drove his hands through his bushy hair, and spoke
more vehemently than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> his teacher, and not you?&nbsp; My good
friend, I at least am the better judge of what makes a
painter&rsquo;s education.&nbsp; Is the man who shows a Giotto
how to use this brush, or mix that paint, to be called his
teacher?&nbsp; No, not for teaching him, forsooth, what he would
have learned of anybody, everybody, nobody, somehow, anyhow, or
done just as well without.&nbsp; But the man who taught him to
work as a matter of principle, and apart from inclination (a
lesson which not all geniuses learn); the man who fostered the
love of Nature in him, and the spirit of poetry,&mdash;qualities
without which draughtsmanship and painting had better not be; the
man who by example and precept led him to find satisfaction in
duty done, and happiness in simple pleasures and domestic
affections; the man who so fixed these high and pure lessons in
his mind, at its most susceptible age, that the foulest dens of
London could not corrupt him; the man whose beloved and
reverenced face would rise up in judgment against him if he could
ever hereafter degrade his art to be a pander of vice, or a mere
trick of the workshop;&mdash;this man, Master Swift, has been the
painter&rsquo;s schoolmaster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Swift was not accustomed to betray emotion, but his
nerves were less strong than they had been, and self-control was
more difficult; and with his horny hands he hid the cheeks down
which tears of gratified pride would force their way.</p>
<p>He had not found voice to speak, when Rufus appeared at the
gate with one basket, followed by Jan and the little innkeeper
with another.&nbsp; Why Master Chuter had come, and why Jan was
looking so particularly well satisfied, must be explained.</p>
<p>Whilst the painter was still gazing across the water-meadows,
Master Swift, who was the soul of hospitality, had told Jan where
to find a few shillings in a certain drawer, and had commissioned
him to lay these out in the wherewithal for an evening
meal.&nbsp; Jan had had some anxiety in connection with the duty
intrusted to him.&nbsp; Firstly, he well knew that the few
shillings were what the schoolmaster must depend on for that
week&rsquo;s living.&nbsp; Secondly, though it was his old
friend&rsquo;s all, it was a sum very inadequate to provide such
a meal as Jan would have liked to set before the painter.&nbsp;
At his age, children are very sensitive on behalf of their
grown-up friends, and like to maintain the credit of home.&nbsp;
The provoking point was that Jan had plenty of pocket-money, with
which he could have supplied deficiencies, had he dared; for the
painter, besides buying him an outfit for the journey, had
liberally rewarded him for his work at the pot boiler.&nbsp; But
Jan knew the pride of Master Swift&rsquo;s heart too well to
venture to add a half penny to his money, or to spend a half
penny less than all.</p>
<p>It was whilst he was going with an anxious countenance towards
the village shop that Master Chuter met him with open arms.&nbsp;
The little innkeeper was genuinely delighted to see him; and the
news of his arrival having spread, several old friends (including
&ldquo;Willum&rdquo; Smith) were waiting for him, about the
yardway of the Heart of Oak.&nbsp; When the innkeeper discovered
Jan&rsquo;s errand, he insisted on packing up a prime cut of
bacon, some new-laid eggs, and a bottle of &ldquo;crusty&rdquo;
old port, such as the squires drank at election dinners, to take
to the schoolmaster.&nbsp; Jan was far too glad of this
seasonable addition to the feast to suggest doubts of its
acceptance; indeed, he ventured on a hint about a possible lack
of wine-glasses, which Master Chuter quickly took, and soon
filled up his basket with ancient glasses on bloated legs, a
clean table-cloth, and so forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t say any thing about the
glasses,&rdquo; suggested Jan, as they drew near the cottage.</p>
<p>Master Chuter winked the little eye buried in his fat left
cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knows the schoolmaster, Jan.&nbsp; He be mortal
proud; and I wouldn&rsquo;t offend he, sartinly not, Jan.&nbsp;
But Master Swift and me have seen a deal of each other since you
left, and he&rsquo;ve tasted this port before, when he were so
bad, and he&rsquo;ll not take it amiss from an old
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Chuter was right.&nbsp; The schoolmaster only thanked
him heartily, and pressed him to remain.&nbsp; But the little
innkeeper, bustling round the table with professional solicitude,
declined the invitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be obliged to &rsquo;ee all the same, Master
Swift.&nbsp; But I hope I knows better manners than to intrude on
you and Jan just now, let alone a gentleman on whom I shall have
pleasure in waiting at the Heart of Oak.&nbsp; There be beds,
sir, at your service and Jan&rsquo;s, and well aired they
be.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll be proud to show you the sign, sir,
painted by that boy when he were an infant, as I may say.&nbsp;
But I knowed what was in un.&nbsp; Master Swift can bear me
witness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mark my words,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;the
boy Jan be &rsquo;most as good as a sign-painter
yet.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I do think a will.&nbsp; But you knows
best, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel quite convinced that he will,&rdquo; said the
painter, gravely.</p>
<p>Whilst Master Chuter and the artist thus settled Jan&rsquo;s
career, he cooked the eggs and bacon; and when Master Swift had
propelled himself to the table, and the others (including Rufus)
had taken their seats, the innkeeper drew cork, dusted the
bottle-mouth, and filled the fat-legged wine-glasses; then,
throwing a parting glance over the arrangements of the table, he
withdrew.</p>
<p>Jan&rsquo;s fears for the credit of his home, his anxieties as
to the effect of the frugal living of his old friends upon the
more luxurious taste of his new patron, were very needless.&nbsp;
The artist was delighted with every thing, and when he said that
he had never tasted food so good as the eggs and bacon, or
relished any wine like that from the cellar of the Heart of Oak,
he quite believed what he said.&nbsp; In truth, none should be so
easily pleased as the artistic, when they wish to be so, since if
&ldquo;we receive but what we give,&rdquo; and our happiness in
any thing is according to the mind we bring to it, imaginative
people must have an advantage in being able to put so much rose
color into their spectacles.</p>
<p>Warmed by the good cheer, Master Swift discoursed as
vigorously as of old.&nbsp; With a graphic power of narration,
commoner in his class than in a higher one, he entertained the
artist with stories of Jan&rsquo;s childhood, and gave a vivid
picture of his own first sight of him in the wood.&nbsp; He did
not fail to describe the long blue coat, the pig-switch, and the
slate, nor did he omit to quote the lines which so well described
the scene which the child-genius was painting in leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well have I named him Giotto!&rdquo; said the artist;
&ldquo;the shepherd boy drawing on the sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye&rsquo;d seen the swineherd painting with
nature&rsquo;s own tints,&rdquo; said Master Swift, with a
pertinacious adherence to his own view of things, which had
always been characteristic of him, &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;d
have thought he beat the shepherd boy.&nbsp; Not that I could
pretend to be a judge of the painting myself, sir; what took
<i>my</i> mind was the inventive energy of the child.&nbsp; For
maybe fifty men in a hundred do a thing, if you find them the
tools, and show them the way, but not five can make their own
materials and find a way for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Necessity&rsquo;s the mother of invention,&rdquo; said
the painter, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they say, sir,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster,
smartly; &ldquo;though, from my own experience of the
shiftlessness of necessitous folk, I&rsquo;ve been tempted to
doubt the truth of the proverb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The painter laughed, and thought of the widow, as Master Swift
added, &ldquo;Necessity may be the <i>mother</i> of invention,
sir, but the father must have had a good head on his
shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun had set, the moon had risen, and the dew mixed with
kindred rain-drops on the schoolmaster&rsquo;s flowers, when Jan
and the painter bade him good-by.&nbsp; For half an hour past it
had seemed to the painter that he was exhausted, and spoke
languidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get up till I come in the morning, Master
Swift,&rdquo; said Jan; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come early and dress
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rufus walked with them to the gate, and waved his tail as Jan
kissed his soft nose and brow, but then he went back to Master
Swift and lay down at his feet.&nbsp; The old man had refused to
have the door shut, and he propelled his chair to the porch
again, and lay looking at the stars.&nbsp; The moon set, and the
night grew cold, so that Rufus tucked his nose deeper into his
fur, but Master Swift did not close the door.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The sun was shining brightly when Jan came back in the
morning.&nbsp; It was very early.&nbsp; The convolvulus bells
were open, but Rufus and the schoolmaster still slept.&nbsp;
Jan&rsquo;s footsteps roused Rufus, who stretched himself and
yawned, but Master Swift did not move, nor answer to Jan&rsquo;s
passionate call upon his name.&nbsp; And in the very peace and
beauty of his countenance Jan saw that he was dead.</p>
<p>But at what hour the silent messenger had come&mdash;whether
at midnight, or at cock-crow, or in the morning&mdash;there was
none to tell.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">GEORGE AGAIN.&mdash;THE
PAINTER&rsquo;S ADVICE.&mdash;&ldquo;HOME BREWED&rdquo; AT THE
HEART OF OAK.&mdash;JAN CHANGES THE PAINTER&rsquo;S
MIND.</span></p>
<p>Master Swift&rsquo;s death was a great shock to the
windmiller, who was himself in frail health; and Jan gave as much
time as he could to cheering his foster-father.</p>
<p>He had been spending an afternoon at the windmill, and the
painter had been sketching the old church from the water-meadows,
when they met on the little bridge near Dame Datchett&rsquo;s,
and strolled together to the Heart of Oak.&nbsp; Master Chuter
met them at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be a letter for you, Jan,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas brought by a young varment I knows well.&nbsp;
He belongs to them that keeps a low public at the foot of the
hill, and he do be for all the world like a hudmedud, without the
usefulness of un.&rdquo;&nbsp; The letter was dirty and
ill-written enough to correspond to the innkeeper&rsquo;s account
of its origin.&nbsp; Misspellings omitted, it ran
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Master Jan
Ford</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;If so be you wants to know where you come
from, and where to look for them as belongs to you, come to the
public at the foot of the hill this evening, with a few pounds in
your pocket to open the lips of them as knows.&nbsp; But fair
play, mind.&nbsp; Gearge bean&rsquo;t such a vool as a looks, and
cart-horses won&rsquo;t draw it out of un, if you sets on the
police.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you be took in by that cusnashun old
rascal Cheap John.&nbsp; You may hold your head as high as the
Squire yet, if you makes it worth the while of <i>One who
knows</i>.&nbsp; I always was fond of you, Jan, my dear.&nbsp;
Keep it dark.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The painter decided to accept the invitation; but when George
Sannel&rsquo;s face loomed out of the smoke of the dingy little
kitchen, all the terrors of his childhood seemed to awake again
in Jan.&nbsp; The face looked worn and hungry, and alarmed; but
it was the face of the miller&rsquo;s man.&nbsp; In truth, he had
deserted from his regiment, and was in hiding; but of this Jan
and his master knew nothing.</p>
<p>If George&rsquo;s face bore some tokens of change, he seemed
otherwise the same as of old.&nbsp; Cunning and stupidity,
distrust and obstinacy, joined with unscrupulous greed, still
marked his loutish attempts to overreach.&nbsp; Indeed, his surly
temper would have brought the conference to an abrupt end but for
the interference of the girl at the inn.&nbsp; She had written
the letter for him, and seemed to take an interest in his fate
which it is hardly likely that he deserved.&nbsp; She acted as
mediator, and the artist was all the more disposed to credit her
assurance that &ldquo;Gearge did know a deal about the young
gentleman, and should tell it all,&rdquo; because her appearance
was so very picturesque.&nbsp; She did good service, when George
began to pursue his old policy of mixing some lies with the truth
he told, by calling him to account.&nbsp; Nor was she daunted by
his threatening glances.&nbsp; &ldquo;It be no manners of use
thee looking at me like that, Gearge Sannel,&rdquo; said she,
folding her arms in a defiant attitude, which the painter hastily
committed to memory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I give my word to
the gentleman that he should hear a straight tale?&nbsp; And it
be all to your advantage to tell it.&nbsp; You wants money, and
the gentleman wants the truth.&nbsp; It be no mortal use to you
to make up a tale, beyond annying the gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under pressure, therefore, George told all that he knew
himself, and what he had learned from the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
wife, and part of the purchase-money of the pot boiler was his
reward.</p>
<p>Master Lake confirmed his account of Jan&rsquo;s first coming
to the mill.&nbsp; He took the liveliest interest in his
foster-son&rsquo;s fate, but he thought, with the artist, that
there was little &ldquo;satisfaction&rdquo; to be got out of
trying to trace Jan&rsquo;s real parentage.&nbsp; It was the
painter&rsquo;s deliberate opinion, and he impressed it upon Jan,
as they sat together in Master Chuter&rsquo;s parlor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Giotto, I do hope you are not building much on
hopes of a new home and new relatives.&nbsp; If all we have heard
is true, your mother is dead; and, if your father is not dead
too, he has basely deserted you.&nbsp; You have to make a name,
not to seek one; to confer credit, not to ask for it.&nbsp; And I
don&rsquo;t say this, Giotto, to make you vain, but to recall
your responsibilities, and to dispel useless dreams.&nbsp;
Believe me, my boy, your true mother, the tender nurse of your
infancy, sleeps in the sacred shadow of this dear old
church.&nbsp; It is your part to make her name, and the name of
your respectable foster-father, famous as your own; to render
your windmill as highly celebrated as Rembrandt&rsquo;s, and to
hang late laurels of fame on the grave of your grand old
schoolmaster.&nbsp; Ah! my child, I know well that the ductile
artistic nature takes shape very early.&nbsp; The coloring of
childhood stains every painter&rsquo;s canvas who paints from the
heart.&nbsp; You can never call any other place home, Giotto, but
this idyllic corner of the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be seen that the painter&rsquo;s rose-colored
spectacles were still on his nose.&nbsp; Every thing delighted
him.&nbsp; He was never weary of sketching garrulous patriarchs
in snowy smocks under rickety porches.&nbsp; He said that in an
age of criticism it was quite delightful to hear Daddy Angel say,
&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; to every thing; and he waxed eloquent on
the luxury of having only one post a day, and that one
uncertain.&nbsp; But his highest flights of approbation were
given to the home-brewed ale.&nbsp; That pure, refreshing
beverage, sound and strong as a heart of oak should be, which
quenched the thirst with a certain stringency which might hint at
sourness to the vulgar palate, had&mdash;so he
said&mdash;destroyed for ever his contentment with any other malt
liquor.&nbsp; He spoke of Bass and Allsopp as &ldquo;palatable
tonics&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-poisonous medicinal
compounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when, with a flourish of hyperbole,
he told Master Chuter&rsquo;s guests that nothing to eat or drink
was to be got in London, they took his word for it; and it was
without suspicion of satire that Daddy Angel said, &ldquo;The
gen&rsquo;leman do look pretty middlin&rsquo; hearty
too&mdash;con-sid&rsquo;rin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident that the painter had no intention of going away
till the pot boiler fund was exhausted, and Jan was willing
enough to abide, especially as Master Lake had caught cold at the
schoolmaster&rsquo;s funeral, and was grateful for his
foster-son&rsquo;s company and care.&nbsp; Jan was busy in many
ways.&nbsp; He was Master Swift&rsquo;s heir; but the old
man&rsquo;s illness had nearly swallowed up his savings, and
Jan&rsquo;s legacy consisted of the books, the furniture, the
gardening tools, and Rufus, who attached himself to his new
master with a wistful affection which seemed to say, &ldquo;You
belong to the good old times, and I know you loved
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan moved the schoolmaster&rsquo;s few chattels to the
windmill, and packed the books to take to London.&nbsp; With them
he packed the little old etching that had been bought from the
Cheap Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very good one,&rdquo; said
the painter.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s by an old Dutch
artist.&nbsp; You can see a copy in the British
Museum.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it was not in the Museum that Jan first
saw a duplicate of his old favorite.</p>
<p>He was nailing up this box one afternoon, and humming as he
did so,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But I alone am left to pine,<br />
And sit beneath the withy tree,<br />
For truth and honesty be gone&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when the painter came in behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that doleful strain, Giotto, I beg; you&rsquo;ve
been painfully sentimental the last day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old song they sing about here,
sir,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the song, you&rsquo;ve been doleful
yourself, Giotto!&nbsp; I believe you&rsquo;re dissatisfied that
we do not push the search for your father.&nbsp; Is it money you
want, child?&nbsp; Believe me, riches enough lie between your
fingers and your miller&rsquo;s thumb.&nbsp; Or do you want a
more fashionable protector than the old artist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, sir!&rdquo; cried Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never
want to leave you; and it&rsquo;s not money I want,
but&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my boy?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my mother, sir,&rdquo; said Jan, with
flushed cheeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;My real mother, I mean.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t desert me, sir; she died&mdash;when I was
born.&nbsp; I doubt nobody sees to her grave, sir.&nbsp; Perhaps
there&rsquo;s nobody but me who would.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t do any
thing for her now, sir, I know; but it seems as if I hardly did
my duty in not knowing where she lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The painter&rsquo;s hands were already deep in his loose
pockets, from which, jumbled up with chalk, india-rubber, bits of
wash-leather, cakes of color, reed pens, a penknife, and some
drawing-pins, he brought the balance of his loose cash, and
became absorbed in calculations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that box
ready?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;We start to-morrow,
mind.&nbsp; You are right, and I was wrong; but my wish was to
spare you possible pain.&nbsp; I now think it is your duty to
risk the possible pain.&nbsp; If those rascally creatures who
stole you are in London, the police will find them.&nbsp; Be
content, Giotto; you shall stand by your mother&rsquo;s
grave!&rdquo;</p>

me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you see him?&rdquo; asked Amabel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know I&rsquo;ve told you I get up very early
just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; interrupted
Amabel, &ldquo;when you know Mademoiselle won&rsquo;t let me get
up till half-past eight.&nbsp; Oh, I wish we were going home this
week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, Amabel, but do listen.&nbsp; I
was down by the river, and there he was sketching; and oh, so
beautifully!&nbsp; I shall burn all my copies; I can never draw
like him.&nbsp; Amabel, he is <i>awfully</i> like me, and he must
be very near my age.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s like what people&rsquo;s
twin-brothers are, you know.&nbsp; I wish he were my
twin-brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t be your twin-brother,&rdquo; said
Amabel, gravely; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s not exactly not a gentleman,&rdquo;
said D&rsquo;Arcy.&nbsp; &ldquo;However, I asked him if he sent
his pictures to the Academy, and he said no, but his master does,
the artist he lives with.&nbsp; And he told me his master&rsquo;s
name, and the number of his pictures; and I&rsquo;ve brought you
a catalogue, and the numbers are 401, 402, and 403.&nbsp; And we
are going to the Academy this afternoon, and I&rsquo;ve asked
mamma to ask Lady Louisa to let you come with us.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t say any thing about me and the boy, for I don&rsquo;t
want it to be known I have been out early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Mademoiselle, who had been looking into the
garden from an upper window, hastened to fetch Amabel
indoors.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was between three and four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,
and the Academy was crowded.&nbsp; The crush was so oppressive
that Lady Adelaide wanted to go away, but D&rsquo;Arcy had
expressed a wish to see No. 401, and D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s wishes
were law to his father, so he struggled in search of the picture,
and the others followed him.&nbsp; And when a small crowd that
was round it had dispersed, they saw it quite clearly.</p>
<p>It was the painter&rsquo;s <i>picture</i>.&nbsp; As the other
spectators passed, they spoke of the coloring and the
draughtsmanship; of the mellow glow of sunshine, which, faithful
to the richness of southern summers, carried also a poetical hint
of the air of glory in which genius lives alone.&nbsp; To some
the graceful figure of Cimabue was familiar, but the new group
round the picture saw only the shepherd lad.&nbsp; And if, as the
spectators said, his eyes haunted them about the room, what
ghosts must they not have summoned to haunt Mr. Ford&rsquo;s
client as he gazed?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mais c&rsquo;est Monsieur D&rsquo;Arcy!&rdquo; screamed
the French governess.&nbsp; And Amabel said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Bogy; but he&rsquo;s got no leaves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lady Adelaide
was quite composed.&nbsp; The likeness was very striking, but her
maternal eyes saw a thousand points of difference between the
Giotto of the painting and her son.&nbsp; &ldquo;How very
odd!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder who sat for the
Giotto?&nbsp; If he really were the boy Amabel thinks she saw in
the wood, I think her Bogy and the model must both be the same as
a wonderful child Mr. Ammaby was telling me about, who painted
the sign of the inn in his village; but his father was a
windmiller called Lake, and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma! mamma!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Arcy, &ldquo;papa is
ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of his son&rsquo;s voice recalled Mr. Ford&rsquo;s
client to consciousness; but it was a very partial and confused
consciousness.&nbsp; He heard voices speaking of the heat, the
crush, etc., as in a dream.&nbsp; He was not sure whether he was
being carried or led along.&nbsp; The painting was no longer
before him, but it mattered little.&nbsp; The shepherd
boy&rsquo;s eyes were as dark as his own; but that look in their
upward gaze, which stirred every heart, pierced his as it had
moved it years ago from eyes the color of a summer sky.&nbsp; To
others their pathos spoke of yearning genius at war with fortune;
but for Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client they brought back, out of the
past, words which rang more clearly in his ears than the
condolences of the crowd,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember your promise, D&rsquo;Arcy?&nbsp;
You will be quite sure to take me home to bury me?&nbsp; And you
will call my child after my father,&mdash;JAN?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE
DETECTIVE.&mdash;THE &ldquo;JOOK.&rdquo;&mdash;JAN STANDS BY HIS
MOTHER&rsquo;S GRAVE.&mdash;HIS AFTER HISTORY.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> he had resolved, the painter
secured the help of the police in tracing Jan&rsquo;s
pedigree.&nbsp; He did not take the bow-legged boy into his
confidence, but that young gentleman recognized the detective
officer when he opened the door for him; and he laid his finger
by his snub nose, with a wink of intense satisfaction.</p>
<p>On hearing the story, the detective expressed his opinion
(founded on acquaintance with Sal) that George&rsquo;s pocket had
been picked by his companions, and not by chance thieves in the
fair; and he finally proved his sagacity in the guess by bringing
the pocket-book and the letter to the artist.</p>
<p>With his mother&rsquo;s letter (it had been written at
Moerdyk, on her way to England) before them, Jan and the artist
were sitting, when Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client was announced, and Jan
stood face to face with his father.</p>
<p>The gentle reader will willingly leave a veil over that
meeting, which the artist felt a generous shame to witness.&nbsp;
With less delicacy, the bow-legged boy had lingered outside the
door, but when the studio rang with a passionate
cry,&mdash;&ldquo;My son! my son!&rdquo;&mdash;he threw his green
baize apron over his head, and crying, &ldquo;The jook!&rdquo;
plunged downwards into the basement, and shed tears of sympathy
amongst the boots and bottles.</p>
<p>To say that Lady Adelaide forgave the past, and received her
husband&rsquo;s son with kindness, is to do scant justice to the
generous affection which he received from her.&nbsp; With pity
for her husband mingled painful astonishment that he should have
trusted her so little; but if the blow could never be quite
repaired, love rarely meets with its exact equivalent in faith or
tenderness, and she did not suffer alone.&nbsp; She went with Jan
and his father to visit Master Lake, and her gracious thanks to
the windmiller for his care of her step-son gave additional
bitterness to her husband&rsquo;s memories of the windmill.</p>
<p>It was she who first urged that they should go to
Holland.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s grandfather was dead,&mdash;Mr.
Ford&rsquo;s client could make no reparation there,&mdash;but the
cousin to whom the old wooden house now belonged gave Jan many
things which had been his mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Amongst these was
a book of sketches by herself, and a collection of etchings by
her great-grandfather, a Dutch artist; and in this collection Jan
found the favorite of his childhood.&nbsp; Did the genius in him
really take its rise in the old artist who etched those willows
which he had once struggled to rival with slate-pencil?</p>
<p>His mother&rsquo;s sketches were far inferior to his own; but
with the loving and faithful study of nature which they showed,
perhaps, too, with the fact that they were chiefly gathered from
homely and homelike scenes, from level horizons and gray skies,
Jan felt a sympathy which stirred him to the heart.&nbsp; His
delight in them touched Lady Adelaide even more than it moved his
father.&nbsp; But then no personal inconvenience in the past, no
long habits of suffering and selfishness, blunted her sense of
the grievous wrong that had been done to her husband&rsquo;s
gifted son.&nbsp; Nor to him alone!&nbsp; It was with her
husband&rsquo;s dead wife that Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s sympathies
were keenest,&mdash;the mother, like herself, of an only
child.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client went almost unwillingly to his
wife&rsquo;s grave, by the side of which her old father&rsquo;s
bones now rested.&nbsp; But Jan and Lady Adelaide hastened
thither, hand in hand, and the painter&rsquo;s pledge was
redeemed.&nbsp; Since the old man died, it had been little
tended, and weeds grew rank where flowers had once been
planted.&nbsp; Jan threw himself on the neglected grave.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My poor mother!&rdquo; he cried, almost bitterly.&nbsp;
For a moment the full sense of their common wrong seemed to
overwhelm him, and he shrank even from Lady Adelaide.&nbsp; But
when, kneeling beside him, she bent her face as if the wind that
sighed among the grass stalks could carry her words to ears long
dulled in death,&mdash;&ldquo;My <i>poor</i> child!&nbsp;
<i>I</i> will be a mother to your son!&rdquo;&mdash;Jan&rsquo;s
heart turned back with a gush of gratitude to his good
stepmother.</p>
<p>He had much reason to be grateful: then, and through many
succeeding years, when her training fitted him to take his place
without awkwardness in society, and her tender care atoned (so
she hoped) for the hardships of the past.</p>
<p>The brotherly love between Jan and D&rsquo;Arcy was a source
of great comfort to her.&nbsp; Once only was it threatened with
estrangement.&nbsp; It was when they had grown up into young men,
and each believed that he was in love with Amabel.&nbsp; Jan had
just prepared to sacrifice himself (and Amabel) with enthusiasm
to his brother, when D&rsquo;Arcy luckily discovered that he and
the playmate of his childhood were not really suited to each
other.&nbsp; It was the case.&nbsp; The conventionalities of
English society in his own rank were part of D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s
very life, but to Amabel they had been made so distasteful in the
hands of Lady Craikshaw that her energetic, straight-forward
spirit was in continual revolt; and it was not the least of
Jan&rsquo;s merits in her eyes that his life had been what it
was, that he was so different from the rest of the people amongst
whom she lived, and that the interests and pleasures which they
had in common were such as the world of fashion could neither
give nor take away.</p>
<p>Withheld from sacrificing his affections to his brother, Jan
joined with his father to cut off the entail of his
property.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rsquo;Arcy is your heir, sir,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope to live well by my art, and <span
class="smcap">God</span> forbid that I should disinherit Lady
Adelaide&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His great gift did indeed bring fortune as well as fame to our
hero.</p>
<p>The Boys&rsquo; Home knows this.&nbsp; It has some generous
patrons (it should have many!), and first amongst them must rank
the great painter who sometimes presides at its annual festival,
and is wont on such occasions pleasantly to speak of himself as
&ldquo;an old boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More accurately entitled to that character is the bow-legged
man-servant of another artist,&mdash;Jan&rsquo;s old
master.&nbsp; These two live on together, and each would find it
difficult to say whether pride and pleasure in the good luck of
their old companion, or the never healed pain of his loss, is the
stronger feeling in their kindly hearts.</p>
<p>Amabel was her father&rsquo;s heir, and in process of time Jan
became the Squire, and went back to spend his life under the
skies which inspired his childhood.&nbsp; But his wife is wont to
say that she believes his true vocation was to be a miller, so
strong is the love of windmills in him, and so proud is he of his
Miller&rsquo;s Thumb.</p>
<p>At one time Mr. Ammaby wished him to take his name and arms,
but Jan decided to keep his own.&nbsp; And it is by this name
that Fame writes him in her roll of painters, and not by that of
the old Squires of Ammaby, nor by the name he bore when he was a
Child of the Windmill.</p>

308</span>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm"><span
class="GutSmall">CONCLUSION.</span></p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">south-west</span> wind is blowing over
the plains.&nbsp; It drives the &ldquo;messengers&rdquo; over the
sky, and the sails of the windmill, and makes the dead leaves
dance upon the graves.&nbsp; It does much to dispel the evil
effects of the foul smells and noxious gases, which are commoner
yet in the little village than one might suppose.&nbsp; (But it
is a long time, you see, since the fever was here.)&nbsp; It
shows the silver lining of the willow leaves by the little river,
and bends the flowers which grow in one glowing mass&mdash;like
some gorgeous Eastern carpet&mdash;on Master Swift&rsquo;s
grave.&nbsp; It rocks Jan&rsquo;s sign in mid-air above the Heart
of Oak, where Master Chuter is waiting upon a newly arrived
guest.</p>
<p>It is the man of business.&nbsp; Long has he promised to try
the breezes of the plains for what he calls dyspepsia, and the
artist calls &ldquo;money-grubbing-on-the-brain,&rdquo; but he
never could find leisure, until a serious attack obliged him to
do so.&nbsp; But at that moment the painter could not leave
London, and he is here alone.&nbsp; He has not said that he knows
Jan, for it amuses him to hear the little innkeeper ramble on
with anecdotes of the great painter&rsquo;s childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ale is fine,&rdquo; says the man of
business.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never can touch beer at home.&nbsp; The
painter is married, you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ve been married these two year,&rdquo; Master
Chuter replies.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they do say Miss Amabel have
been partial to him from a child.&nbsp; He come down here, sir,
soon after his father took to him, and he draad out Miss
Amabel&rsquo;s old white horse for her; and the butler have told
me, sir, that it hangs in the library now.&nbsp; It be more fit
for an inn sign, sartinly, it be, but the gentry has their whims,
sir, and Miss Amabel was a fine young lady.&nbsp; The
Squire&rsquo;s moral image she be; affable and free, quite
different to her ladyship.&nbsp; Coffee, sir?&nbsp; No,
sir?&nbsp; Dined, sir?&nbsp; It be a fine evening, sir, if
you&rsquo;d like to see the church.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be glad to
show it you, myself, sir.&nbsp; Old Solomon have got the
key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the main street of the village even the man of business
strolls.&nbsp; There is no hurrying in this atmosphere.&nbsp; It
is a matter of time to find Old Solomon, and of more time to make
him hear when he is found, and of most time for him to find the
key when he hears.&nbsp; But time is not money to the merchant
just now, and he watches the western sky patiently, and is made
sleepy by the breeze.&nbsp; When at last they saunter under the
shadow of the gray church tower, his eye is caught by the mass of
color, out of which springs a high cross of white marble, whose
top is just flushed by the setting sun.&nbsp; It is of fine
design and workmanship, and marks the grave where the great
man&rsquo;s schoolmaster sleeps near his wife and child.&nbsp;
Hard by, Master Chuter shows the &ldquo;fever monument,&rdquo;
and the names of Master Lake&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; And then, as
Daddy Solomon has fumbled the door open, they pass into the
church.&nbsp; The east end has been restored, the innkeeper says,
by the Squire, under the advice of his son-in-law.</p>
<p>And then they turn to look at the west window,&mdash;the new
window, the boast of the parish,&mdash;at which even old Solomon
strains his withered eyes with a sense of pride.&nbsp; The man of
business stands where Jan used to sit.&nbsp; The unchanged faces
look down on him from the old window.&nbsp; But it is not the old
window that he looks at, it is the new one.&nbsp; The glory of
the setting sun illumines it, and throws crimson lights from the
vesture of the principal figure&mdash;like stains of
blood&mdash;upon the pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be the Good Shepherd,&rdquo; Master Chuter explains,
but his guest is silent.&nbsp; The pale-faced, white-haired
angels in the upper lights seem all ablaze, and Old Solomon
cannot look at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them sheep be beautiful,&rdquo; whispers the innkeeper;
but the stranger heeds him not.&nbsp; He is reading the
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To the Glory of GOD</i>,<br />
<i>And in pious memory of Abel</i>, <i>my dear
foster-brother</i>:<br />
<i>I</i>, <i>who designed this window</i>,<br />
<i>Dedicate it</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

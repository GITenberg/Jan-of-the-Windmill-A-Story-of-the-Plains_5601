<br>
CHAPTER I. THE WINDMILLER&rsquo;S WIFE. - STRANGERS. - TEN SHILLINGS
A WEEK. - THE LITTLE JAN.<br>
<br>
Storm without and within?<br>
<br>
So the windmiller might have said, if he had been in the habit of putting
his thoughts into an epigrammatic form, as a groan from his wife and
a growl of thunder broke simultaneously upon his ear, whilst the rain
fell scarcely faster than her tears.<br>
<br>
It was far from mending matters that both storms were equally unexpected.&nbsp;
For eight full years the miller&rsquo;s wife had been the meekest of
women.&nbsp; If there was a firm (and yet, as he flattered himself,
a just) husband in all the dreary straggling district, the miller was
that man.&nbsp; And he always did justice to his wife&rsquo;s good qualities,
- at least to her good quality of submission, - and would, till lately,
have upheld her before any one as a model of domestic obedience.&nbsp;
From the day when he brought home his bride, tall, pretty, and perpetually
smiling, to the tall old mill and the ugly old mother who never smiled
at all, there had been but one will in the household.&nbsp; At any rate,
after the old woman&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; For during her life-time her
stern son paid her such deference that it was a moot point, perhaps,
which of them really ruled.&nbsp; Between them, however, the young wife
was moulded to a nicety, and her voice gained no more weight in the
counsels of the windmill when the harsh tones of the mother-in-law were
silenced for ever.<br>
<br>
The miller was one of those good souls who live by the light of a few
small shrewdities (often proverbial), and pique themselves on sticking
to them to such a point, as if it were the greater virtue to abide by
a narrow rule the less it applied.&nbsp; The kernel of his domestic
theory was, &ldquo;Never yield, and you never will have to,&rdquo; and
to this he was proud of having stuck against all temptations from a
real, though hard, affection for his own; and now, after working so
smoothly for eight years, had it come to this?<br>
<br>
The miller scratched his bead, and looked at his wife, almost with amazement.&nbsp;
She moaned, though he bade her be silent; she wept, in spite of words
which had hitherto been an effectual styptic to her tears; and she met
the commonplaces of his common sense with such wild, miserable laughter,
that he shuddered as he heard her.<br>
<br>
Weakness in human beings is like the strength of beasts, a power of
which fortunately they are not always conscious.&nbsp; Unless positively
brutal, you cannot well beat a sickly woman for wailing and weeping;
and if she will not cease for any lesser consideration, there seems
nothing for an unbending husband to do but to leave her to herself.<br>
<br>
This the miller had to do, anyhow.&nbsp; For he could only spare a moment&rsquo;s
attention to her now and then, since the mill required all his care.<br>
<br>
In a coat and hat of painted canvas, he had been in and out ever since
the storm began; now directing the two men who were working within,
now struggling along the stage that ran outside the windmill, at no
small risk of being fairly blown away.<br>
<br>
He had reefed the sails twice already in the teeth of the blinding rain.&nbsp;
But he did well to be careful.&nbsp; For it was in such a storm as this,
five years ago &ldquo;come Michaelmas,&rdquo; that the worst of windmill
calamities had befallen him, - the sails had been torn off his mill
and dashed into a hundred fragments upon the ground.&nbsp; And such
a mishap to a seventy feet tower mill means - as windmillers well know
- not only a stoppage of trade, but an expense of two hundred pounds
for the new sails.<br>
<br>
Many a sack of grist, which should have come to him had gone down to
the watermill in the valley before the new sails were at work; and the
huge debt incurred to pay for them was not fairly wiped out yet.&nbsp;
That catastrophe had kept the windmiller a poor man for five years,
and it gave him a nervous dread of storms.<br>
<br>
And talking of storms, here was another unreasonable thing.&nbsp; The
morning sky had been (like the miller&rsquo;s wedded life) without a
cloud.&nbsp; The day had been sultry, for the time of year unseasonably
so.&nbsp; And, just when the miller most grudged an idle day, when times
were hard, when he was in debt, - for some small matters, as well as
the sail business, - and when, for the first time in his life, he felt
almost afraid of his own hearthstone, and would fain have been busy
at his trade, not a breath of wind had there been to turn the sails
of the mill.&nbsp; Not a waft to cool his perplexed forehead, not breeze
enough to stir the short grass that glared for miles over country flat
enough to mock him with the fullest possible view of the cloudless sky.&nbsp;
Then towards evening, a few gray flecks had stolen up from the horizon
like thieves in the dusk, and a mighty host of clouds had followed them;
and when the wind did come, it came in no moderate measure, but brought
this awful storm upon its wings, which now raged as if all the powers
of mischief had got loose, and were bent on turning every thing topsy-turvy
indoors and out.<br>
<br>
What made the winds and clouds so perverse, the clerk of the weather
best knows; but there was a reason for the unreasonableness of the windmiller&rsquo;s
wife.<br>
<br>
She had lost her child, her youngest born, and therefore, at present,
her best beloved.&nbsp; This girl-babe was the sixth of the windmiller
and his wife&rsquo;s children, the last that God gave them, and the
first that it had pleased Him to take away.<br>
<br>
The mother had been weak herself at the time that the baby fell ill,
and unusually ill-fitted to bear a heavy blow.&nbsp; Then her watchful
eyes had seen symptoms of ailing in the child long before the windmiller&rsquo;s
good sense would allow a fuss to be made, and expense to be incurred
about a little peevishness up or down.&nbsp; And it was some words muttered
by the doctor when he did come, about not having been sent for soon
enough, which were now doing as much as any thing to drive the poor
woman frantic.&nbsp; They struck a blow, too, at her blind belief in
the miller&rsquo;s invariable wisdom.&nbsp; If he had but listened to
her in this matter, were it only for love&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp; There
was something, she thought, in what that woman had said who came to
help her with the last offices, - the miller discouraged &ldquo;neighbors,&rdquo;
but this was a matter of decency, - that it was as foolish for a man
to have the say over babies and housework as it would be for his wife
to want her word in the workshop or the mill.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a state of subjection for grown-up people does not tend to make
them reasonable, especially in their indignations.&nbsp; The windmiller&rsquo;s
wife dared not, for her life, have told him in so many words that she
thought it would be for their joint benefit if he would give a little
more consideration to her wishes and opinions; but from this suppressed
idea came many sharp and peevish words at this time, which, apart from
their true source, were quite as unreasonable and perverse as the miller
held them to be.&nbsp; Nor is being completely under the control of
another, self-control.&nbsp; It may be doubted if it can even do much
to teach it.&nbsp; The thread of her passive condition having been,
for the time, broken by grief, the bereaved mother moaned and wailed,
and rocked herself, and beat her breast, and turned fiercely upon all
interference, like some poor beast in anguish.<br>
<br>
She had clung to her children with an almost morbid tenderness, in proportion
as she found her worthy husband stern and cold.&nbsp; A hard husband
sometimes makes a soft mother, and it is perhaps upon the baby of the
family that her repressed affections outpoured themselves most fully.&nbsp;
It was so in this case, at any rate.&nbsp; And the little one had that
unearthly beauty which is seen, or imagined, about children who die
young.&nbsp; And the poor woman had suffered and striven so for it,
to have it and to keep it.&nbsp; The more critical grew its illness,
the intenser grew her strength and resolution by watchfulness, by every
means her instinct and experience could suggest, to fight and win the
battle against death.&nbsp; And when all was vain, the maddening thought
tortured her that it might have been saved.<br>
<br>
The miller had made a mistake, and it was a pity that he made another
on the top of it, with the best intentions.&nbsp; He hurried on the
funeral, hoping that when &ldquo;all was over&rdquo; the mother would
&ldquo;settle down.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But it was this crowning insult to her agony, the shortening of the
too brief time when she could watch by all that remained to her of her
child, which drove her completely wild.&nbsp; She reproached him now
plainly and bitterly enough.&nbsp; She would neither listen to reason
nor obey; and when - with more truth than taste - he observed that other
people lost children, and that they had plenty left, she laughed in
his face that wild laugh which drove him back to the mill and to the
storm.<br>
<br>
How it raged!&nbsp; The miller&rsquo;s wife was an uneducated, commonplace
woman enough, but, in the excited state of her nervous system, she was
as sensible as any poet of a kind of comforting harmony in the wild
sounds without; though at another time they would have frightened her.<br>
<br>
They did not disturb the children, who were in bed.&nbsp; Four in the
old press-bed in the corner, and one in a battered crib, and one in
the narrow bed over which the coverlet was not yet green.<br>
<br>
The day&rsquo;s work was over for her, though it was only just beginning
for the miller, and the mother had nothing to do but weep, and her tears
fell and fell, and the rain poured and poured.&nbsp; That last outburst
had somewhat relieved her, and she almost wished her husband would come
back, as a flash of lightning dazzled her eyes, and the thunder rattled
round the old mill, as if the sails had broken up again, and were falling
upon the roof of the round-house.&nbsp; All her senses were acute to-night,
and she listened for the miller&rsquo;s footsteps, and so, listening,
in the lull after the thunder, she heard another sound.&nbsp; Wheels
upon the road.<br>
<br>
A pang shot through her heart.&nbsp; Thus had the doctor&rsquo;s gig
sounded the night he came, - alas, too late!&nbsp; How long and how
intensely she had listened for that!&nbsp; She first heard it just beyond
the mile-stone.&nbsp; This one must be a good bit on this side of it;
up the hill, in fact.&nbsp; She could not help listening.&nbsp; It was
so like, so terribly like!&nbsp; Now it spun along the level ground.&nbsp;
Ah, the doctor had not hurried so!&nbsp; Now it was at the mill, at
the door, and - it stopped.<br>
<br>
The miller&rsquo;s wife rose to run out, she hardly knew why.&nbsp;
But in a moment she checked herself, and went back to her seat.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I be crazed, surely,&rdquo; said the poor woman, sitting down
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;There be more gigs than one in the world, and folk
often stops to ask their way of the maester.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
These travellers were a long time about the putting of such a simple
question, especially as the night was not a pleasant one to linger out
in.&nbsp; The murmur of voices, too, which the woman overheard, betokened
a close conversation, in which the familiar drawl of the windmiller&rsquo;s
dialect blended audibly with that kind of clean-clipt speaking peculiar
to gentlefolk.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ve been talking to master&rsquo;s five minute an&rsquo;
more,&rdquo; muttered the miller&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;What can
&rsquo;ee want with un?&rdquo;&nbsp; The talking ceased as she spoke,
and the windmiller appeared, followed by a woman carrying a young baby
in her arms.<br>
<br>
He was a ruddy man for his age at any time, but there was an extra flush
on his cheeks just now, and some excitement in his manner, making him
look as his wife was not wont to see him more than once a year, after
the Foresters&rsquo; dinner at the Heart of Oak.&nbsp; There was a difference,
too.&nbsp; A little too much drink made the windmiller peevish and pompous,
but just now he spoke in a kindly, almost conciliating tone.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;See, missus!&nbsp; Let this good lady dry herself a bit, and
get warm, and the little un too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
A woman - ill-favored, though there was no positive fault to be found
with her features, except that the upper lip was long and cleft, and
the lower one very large - came forward with the child, and began to
take off its wraps, and the miller&rsquo;s wife, giving her face a hasty
wipe, went hospitably to help her.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Tst! tst! little love!&rdquo; she cried, gulping down a sob,
due to her own sad memories, and moving the cloak more tenderly than
the woman in whose arms the child lay.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a pair of dark
eyes, then!&nbsp; Is&rsquo;t a boy or girl, m&rsquo;m?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A boy,&rdquo; said a voice from the door, and the miller&rsquo;s
wife, with a suppressed shriek of timidity, became aware of a man whose
entrance she had not perceived, and to whom she dropped a hasty courtesy.<br>
<br>
He was a man slightly above the middle height, whose slenderness made
him seem taller.&nbsp; An old cloak, intended as much to disguise as
to protect him, did not quite conceal a faultlessness of costume beneath
it, after the fashion of the day.&nbsp; Waistcoats of three kinds, one
within the other, a frilled shirt, and a well-adjusted stock, were to
be seen, though he held the ends of the old cloak tightly across him,
as the wind would have caught them in the doorway.&nbsp; He wore a countryman&rsquo;s
hat, which seemed to suit him as little as the cloak, and from beneath
the brim his dark eyes glared with a restless, dissatisfied look, and
were so dark and so fierce and bright that one could hardly see any
other details of his face, unless it were his smooth chin, which, either
from habit or from the stiffness of his stock, he carried strangely
up in the air.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; said the windmiller&rsquo;s wife, courtesying,
and setting a chair, with her eyes wandering back by a kind of fascination
to those of the stranger; &ldquo;be pleased to take a seat, sir.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The stranger sat down for a moment, and then stood up again.&nbsp; Then
he seemed to remember that he still wore his hat, and removed it, holding
it stiffly before him in his gloved hands.&nbsp; This displayed a high,
narrow head, on which the natural hair was worn short and without parting,
and a face which, though worn, was not old.&nbsp; And, for no definable
reason, an impression stole over the windmiller&rsquo;s wife that he,
like her husband, had some wish to conciliate, which in his case struggled
hard with a very different kind of feeling, more natural to him.<br>
<br>
Then he took out a watch of what would now be called the old turnip
shape, and said impatiently to the miller, &ldquo;Our time is short,
my good man.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To be sure, sir,&rdquo; said the windmiller.&nbsp; &ldquo;Missus!
a word with you here.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he led the way into the round-house,
where his wife followed, wondering.&nbsp; Her wonder was not lessened
when he laid his hand upon her shoulder, and, with flushed cheek and
a tone of excitement that once more recalled the Foresters&rsquo; annual
meeting, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had some sore times, missus, of late,
but good luck have come our way to-night.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And how then, maester?&rdquo; faltered his wife.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That child,&rdquo; said the windmiller, turning his broad thumb
expressively towards the inner room, &ldquo;belongs to folk that want
to get a home for un, and can afford to pay for un, too.&nbsp; And the
place being healthy and out of the way, and having heard of our trouble,
and you just bereaved of a little un&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No! no! no!&rdquo; shrieked the poor mother, who now understood
all.&nbsp; &ldquo;I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>, maester, &rsquo;tis unpossible,
I could <i>not</i>.&nbsp; Oh dear! oh dear! isn&rsquo;t it bad enough
to lose the sweetest child that ever saw light, without taking in an
outcast to fill that dear angel&rsquo;s place?&nbsp; Oh dear! oh dear!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And we behindhand in more quarters than one,&rdquo; continued
the miller, prudently ignoring his wife&rsquo;s tears and remonstrances,
&ldquo;and a dear season coming on, and an uncertain trade that keeps
a man idle by days together, and here&rsquo;s ten shillings a week dropped
into our laps, so to speak.&nbsp; Ten shillings a week - regular and
sartin.&nbsp; No less now, and no more hereafter, the governor said.&nbsp;
Them were his words.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s ten shilling a week to me, and my child dead and
gone?&rdquo; moaned the mother, in reply.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s ten shillings a week to you?</i>&rdquo; cried
the windmiller, who was fairly exasperated, in tones so loud that they
were audible in the dwelling room, where the stranger, standing by the
three-legged table, stroked his lips twice or thrice with his hand,
as if to smooth out a cynical smile which strove to disturb their decorous
and somewhat haughty compression.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s ten shilling
a week to you?&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s food to you, and drink to you,
and firing to you, and boots for the children&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; Look
here, my woman.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve had a sore affliction, but that&rsquo;s
not to say you&rsquo;re to throw good luck in the dirt for a whimsey.&nbsp;
This matter&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And the miller strode back into the inner room, whilst his wife sat
upon a sack of barley, wringing her hands, and moaning, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
do my duty by un, maester, I couldn&rsquo;t do my duty by un.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This she repeated at intervals, with her apron over her face, as before;
and then, suddenly aware that her husband had left her, she hurried
into the inner room to plead her own cause.&nbsp; It was too late.&nbsp;
The strangers had gone.&nbsp; The miller was not there, and the baby
lay on the end of the press bedstead, wailing as bitterly as the mother
herself.<br>
<br>
It had been placed there, with a big bundle of clothes by it, before
the miller came back, and he had found it so.&nbsp; He found the stranger
too, with his hat on his head, and his cloak fastened, glancing from
time to time at the child, and then withdrawing his glance hastily,
and looking forcedly round at the meagre furnishing of the miller&rsquo;s
room, and then back at the little bundle on the bed, and away again.&nbsp;
The woman stood with her back to the press-bed, her striped shawl drawn
tightly round her, and her hands folded together as closely as her long
lip pressed the heavy one below.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is it settled?&rdquo; asked the man.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is, sir,&rdquo; said the miller.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
excuse my missus being as she is, but it&rsquo;s fretting for the child
we&rsquo;ve a lost&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I understand, I understand,&rdquo; said the stranger, hastily.&nbsp;
He was pulling back the rings of a silk netted purse, which he had drawn
mechanically from his pocket, and which, from some sudden start of his,
fell chinking on to the floor.&nbsp; Whatever the thought was which
startled him, he thought it so sharply that he looked up in fear that
he had said it aloud.&nbsp; But he had not spoken, and the miller had
no other expression than that of an eager satisfaction on his face as
the stranger counted out the gold by the flaring light of the tallow
candle.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A quarter&rsquo;s pay in advance,&rdquo; he said briefly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will be paid quarterly, you understand.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
which, and checking himself in a look towards the child, he went out,
followed by the woman.<br>
<br>
In the round-house he paused however, and looked back into the meagre,
dimly lighted room, where the little bundle upon the bed lay weeping.&nbsp;
For a moment, a storm of irresolution seemed to seize him, and then
muttering, &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped for the present, it can&rsquo;t
be helped,&rdquo; he hurried towards the vehicle, in the back seat of
which the woman was already seated.<br>
<br>
The driver touched his hat to him as he approached, and turned the cushion,
which he had been protecting from the rain.&nbsp; The stranger stumbled
over the cloak as he got in, and, cursing the step, bade the man drive
like something which had no connection with driving.&nbsp; But, as they
turned, the windmiller ran out and after them.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stop, sir!&rdquo; he cried.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, what now?&rdquo; said the stranger, sharply, as the horse
was pulled back on his haunches.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is it named?&rdquo; gasped the miller.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, all that sort of thing,&rdquo; was the impatient reply.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And what name?&rdquo; asked the miller.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jan.&nbsp; J, A, N,&rdquo; said the stranger, shouting against
the blustering wind.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And - and - the other name?&rdquo; said the windmiller, who was
now standing close to the stranger&rsquo;s ear.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What is yours?&rdquo; he asked, with a sharp look of his dark
eyes.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Lake - Abel,&rdquo; said the windmiller.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is his also, henceforth,&rdquo; said the stranger, waving
his hand, as if to close the subject, - &ldquo;Jan Lake.&nbsp; Drive
on, will you?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The horse started forward, and they whirled away down the wet, gray
road.&nbsp; And before the miller had regained his mill, the carriage
was a distant speck upon the storm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II. THE MILLER&rsquo;S CALCULATIONS. - HIS HOPES AND FEARS.
- THE NURSE-BOY. - CALM.<br>
<br>
The windmiller went back to his work.&nbsp; He had risked something
over this business in leaving the mill in the hands of others, even
for so short a time.&nbsp; Then the storm abated somewhat.&nbsp; The
wind went round, and blew with less violence a fine steady breeze.&nbsp;
The miller began to think of going into the dwelling-room for a bit
of supper to carry him through his night&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; And yet
he lingered about returning to his wife in her present mood.<br>
<br>
He stuck the sharp point of his windmiller&rsquo;s candlestick <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>
into a sack that stood near, and drawing up a yellow canvas &ldquo;sample
bag &ldquo; - which served him as a purse - from the depths of his pocket,
he began to count the coins by the light of the candle.&nbsp; He counted
them over several times with increasing satisfaction, and made several
slow but sure calculations as to the sum of ten shillings a week by
the month, the quarter, the half, and the whole year.&nbsp; He then
began another set of calculations of a kind less pleasant, especially
to an honest man, - his debts.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good bit to the doctor for both times,&rdquo;
he murmured; &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s the coffin, and something at the
Heart of Oak for the bearers, and a couple of bottles red wine there,
too, for the missus, when she were so bad.&nbsp; And both the boys had
new shoes to follow in, - she would have it they should follow&rdquo;
-&nbsp; And so on, and so on, the windmiller ran up the list of his
petty debts, and saw his way to paying them.&nbsp; Then he put the money
back into the sample bag, and folded it very neatly, and stowed it away.&nbsp;
And then he drew near the inner door, and peeped into the room.<br>
<br>
His poor wife seemed to be in no better case than before.&nbsp; She
sat on the old rocking-chair, swinging backwards and forwards, and beating
her hands upon her knees in silence, and making no movement to comfort
the wailing little creature on the bed.<br>
<br>
For the first time there came upon the windmiller a sense of the fact
that it is an uncertain and a rather dangerous game to drive a desperate
woman into a corner.&nbsp; His missus was as soft-hearted a soul as
ever lived, and for her to sit unmoved by the weeping of a neglected
child was a proof that something was very far wrong indeed.&nbsp; One
or two nasty stories of what tender-hearted women had done when &ldquo;crazed&rdquo;
by grief haunted him.&nbsp; The gold seemed to grow hot at the bottom
of his pocket.&nbsp; He wished he had got at the stranger&rsquo;s name
and address, in case it should be desirable to annul the bargain.&nbsp;
He wished the missus would cry again, that silence was worse than any
thing.&nbsp; He wished it did not just happen to come into his head
that her grandmother went &ldquo;melancholy mad&rdquo; when she was
left a young widow, and that she had had an uncle in business who died
of softening of the brain.<br>
<br>
He wished she would move across the room and take up the child, with
an intensity that almost amounted to prayer.&nbsp; And, in the votive
spirit which generally comes with such moments, he mentally resolved
that, if his missus would but &ldquo;take to&rdquo; the infant, he would
humor her on all other points just now to the best of his power.<br>
<br>
A strange fulfilment often treads on the heels of such vows.&nbsp; At
this moment the wailing of the baby disturbed the miller&rsquo;s eldest
son as he lay in the press-bed.&nbsp; He was only seven years old, but
he had been nurse-boy to his dead sister during the brief period of
her health, - the more exclusively so, that the miller&rsquo;s wife
was then weakly, - and had watched by her sick cradle with a grief scarcely
less than that of the mother.&nbsp; He now crept out and down the coverlet
to the wailing heap of clothes, with a bright, puzzled look on his chubby
face.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;mother!&nbsp; Is the little un
come back?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not our&rsquo;n.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s - it&rsquo;s another one.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Have the Lord sent us another?&rdquo; said the boy, lifting the
peak of the little hood from the baby&rsquo;s eye, into which it was
hanging, and then fairly gathering the tiny creature, by a great effort,
into his arms, with the daring of a child accustomed to playing nurse
to one nearly as heavy as himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do be glad of that,
mother.&nbsp; The Lord sent the other one in the night, too, mother;
that night we slept in the round-house.&nbsp; Do &rsquo;ee mind?&nbsp;
Whishty, whishty, love!&nbsp; Eh, mother, what eyes!&nbsp; Whishty,
whishty, then!&nbsp; <i>I&rsquo;m</i> seeing to thee, I am.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
There was something like a sob in the miller&rsquo;s own throat, but
his wife rose, and, running to the bed, fell on her knees, and with
such a burst of weeping as is the thaw of bitter grief gathered her
eldest child and the little outcast together to her bosom.<br>
<br>
At this moment another head was poked up from the bedclothes, and the
second child began to say its say, hoping, perhaps, thereby to get a
share of attention and kisses as well as the other.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I seed a lady and genle&rsquo;m,&rdquo; it broke forth, &ldquo;and
was feared of un.&nbsp; They was going out of doors.&nbsp; The genle&rsquo;m
look back at us, but the lady went right on.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo; see
her face.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Matters were now in a domestic and straightforward condition, and the
windmiller no longer hesitated to come in.&nbsp; But he was less disposed
to a hard and triumphant self-satisfaction than was common with him
when his will ended well.&nbsp; A poor and unsuccessful career had,
indeed, something to do with the hardness of his nature, and in this
flush of prosperity he felt softened, and resolved inwardly to &ldquo;let
the missus take her time,&rdquo; and come back to her ordinary condition
without interference.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Shall un have a bit of supper, missus?&rdquo; was his cheerful
greeting on coming in.&nbsp; &ldquo;But take your time,&rdquo; he added,
seeing her busy with the baby, &ldquo;take your time.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
By-and-by the nurse-boy took the child, and the woman bustled about
the supper.&nbsp; She was still but half reconciled, and slapped the
plates on to the table with a very uncommon irritability.<br>
<br>
The windmiller ate a hearty supper and washed it well down with home-made
ale, under the satisfactory feeling that he could pay for more when
he wanted it.&nbsp; And as he began to plug his pipe with tobacco, and
his wife rocked the new-comer at her breast, he said thoughtfully, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do &rsquo;ee think, missus, that woman &rsquo;ud be the mother
of un?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried his wife, scornfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ve
never been a mother, maester; of this nor any other one.&nbsp; To see
her handle it was enough for me.&nbsp; The boy himself could see she
never so much as looked back at un.&nbsp; To bring an infant out a night
like this, too, and leave it with strangers.&nbsp; Mother, indeed, says
he!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Take your time, missus, take your time!&rdquo; murmured the miller
in his head.&nbsp; He did not speak aloud, he only puffed his pipe.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you suppose the genle&rsquo;m be the father, missus?&rdquo;
he suggested, as he rose to go back to his work.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said his wife, briefly; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak
one way or another to the feelings of men-folk.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This blow was hit straight out, but the windmiller forbore reply.&nbsp;
He was not altogether ill-pleased by it, for the woman&rsquo;s unwonted
peevishness broke down in new tears over the child, whom she bore away
to bed, pouring forth over it half inarticulate indignation against
its unnatural parents.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ve a soft heart, have the missus,&rdquo; said the windmiller,
thoughtfully, as he went to the outer door.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in
doubts if she won&rsquo;t take to it more than her own yet.&nbsp; But
she shall have her own time.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The storm had passed.&nbsp; The wolds lay glistening and dreary under
a watery sky, but all was still.&nbsp; The windmiller looked upwards
mechanically.&nbsp; To be weatherwise was part of his trade.&nbsp; But
his thoughts were not in the clouds to-night.&nbsp; He brought the sample
bag, without thinking of it, to the surface of his pocket, and dropped
it slowly back again, murmuring, &ldquo;Ten shilling a week.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And as he turned again to his night&rsquo;s work he added, with a nod
of complete conviction, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll more&rsquo;n keep <i>he</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
THE WINDMILLER&rsquo;S WORDS COME TRUE. - THE RED SHAWL. - IN THE CLOUDS.
- NURSING V. PIG-MINDING. - THE ROUND-HOUSE. - THE MILLER&rsquo;S THUMB.<br>
<br>
Strange to say, the windmiller&rsquo;s idea came true in time, - the
foster-child was the favorite.<br>
<br>
He was the youngest of the family, for the mother had no more children.&nbsp;
This goes for something.<br>
<br>
Then, when she had once got over her repugnance to adopting him, he
did do much to heal the old grief, and to fill the empty place in her
heart as well as in the cradle.<br>
<br>
He was a frail, fretful little creature, with a very red face just fading
into yellow, about as much golden down on his little pate as would furnish
a moth with plumage, and eyes like sloe-berries.&nbsp; It was fortunate
rather than otherwise that he was so ailing for some weeks that the
good wife&rsquo;s anxieties came over again, and, in the triumph of
being this time successful, much of the bitterness of the old loss passed
away.<br>
<br>
In a month&rsquo;s time he looked healthy, if not absolutely handsome.&nbsp;
The windmiller&rsquo;s wife, indeed, protested that he was lovely, and
she never wearied of marvelling at the unnatural conduct of those who
had found it in their hearts to intrust so sweet a child to the care
of strangers; though it must be confessed that nothing would have pleased
her less than the arrival of two doting and conscientious parents to
reclaim him.<br>
<br>
Indeed, pity had much to do with the large measure of love that she
gave to the deserted child.&nbsp; A meaner sentiment, too, was not quite
without its influence in the predominance which he gradually gained
over his foster brothers and sisters.&nbsp; There was little enough
to be proud of in all that could be guessed as to his parentage (the
windmiller knew nothing), but there was scope for any amount of fancy;
and if the child displayed any better manners or talents than the other
children, Mrs. Lake would purse her lips, and say, with a somewhat shabby
pride, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Anybody may see &rsquo;tis gentry born.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking,&rdquo; said the windmiller, one day,
&ldquo;that if that there woman weren&rsquo;t the mother, &rsquo;tis
likely the mother&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis likely, too,&rdquo; said his wife; and her kindness
abounded the more towards the motherless child.&nbsp; Little Abel was
nurse-boy to it, as he had been to his sister.&nbsp; Not much more than
a baby himself, he would wrap an old shawl round the baby who was quite
a baby, stagger carefully out at the door, and drop dexterously - baby
uppermost - on to the short, dry grass that lay for miles about the
mill.<br>
<br>
The shawl was a special shawl, though old.&nbsp; It was red, and the
bright color seemed to take the child&rsquo;s fancy; he was never so
good as when playing upon the gay old rag.&nbsp; His black eyes would
sparkle, and his tiny fingers clutch at it, when the mother put it about
him as he swayed in Abel&rsquo;s courageous grasp.&nbsp; And then Abel
would spread it for him, like an eastern prayer carpet, under the shadow
of the old mill.<br>
<br>
Little need had he of any medicine, when the fresh strong air that blew
about the downs was filling his little lungs for most of the day.&nbsp;
Little did he want toys, as he lay on his red shawl gazing upwards hour
by hour, with Abel to point out every change in their vast field of
view.<br>
<br>
It is a part of a windmiller&rsquo;s trade to study the heavens, and
Abel may have inherited a taste for looking skywards.&nbsp; Then, on
these great open downs there is so much sky to be seen, you can hardly
help seeing it, and there is not much else to look at.&nbsp; Had they
lived in a village street, or even a lane, Abel and his charge might
have taken to other amusements, - to games, to grubbing in hedges, or
amid the endless treasures of ditches.&nbsp; But as it was, they lay
hour after hour and looked at the sky, as at an open picture-book with
ever-changing leaves.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee here!&rdquo; the nurse-boy would cry.&nbsp; &ldquo;See
to the crows, the pretty black crows!&nbsp; Eh, there be a lapwing!&nbsp;
Lap-py, lap-py, lap-py, there he go!&nbsp; Janny catch un!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And the baby would stretch his arms responsive to Abel&rsquo;s expressive
signs, and cry aloud for the vanishing bird.<br>
<br>
If no living creature crossed the ether, there were the clouds.&nbsp;
Sometimes a long triangular mass of small white fleecy clouds would
stretch across half the heavens, having its shortest side upon the horizon,
and its point at the zenith, where one white fleece seemed to be leading
a gradually widening flock across the sky.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;See then!&rdquo; the nurse-boy would cry.&nbsp; &ldquo;See to
the pretty sheep up yonder!&nbsp; Janny mind un!&nbsp; So! so!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And if some small gray scud, floating lower, ran past the far-away cirrus,
Abel would add with a quaint seriousness, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the sheep-dog.&nbsp;
How he runs then!&nbsp; Bow-wow!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At sunset such a flock wore golden fleeces, and to them, and to the
crimson hues about them, the little Jan stretched his fingers, and crowed,
as if he would have clutched the western sky as he clutched his own
red shawl.<br>
<br>
But Abel was better pleased when, in the dusk, the flock became dark
gray.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They be Master Salter&rsquo;s pigs now,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
For pigs in Abel&rsquo;s native place were both plentiful and black;
and he had herded Master Salter&rsquo;s flock (five and twenty black,
and three spotted) for a whole month before his services were required
as nurse-boy to his sister.<br>
<br>
But for the coming of the new baby, he would probably have gone back
to the pigs.&nbsp; And he preferred babies.&nbsp; A baby demands attention
as well as a herd of pigs, but you can get it home.&nbsp; It does not
run off in twenty-eight different directions, just when you think you
have safely turned the corner into the village.<br>
<br>
Master Salter&rsquo;s swine suffered neglect at the hands of several
successors to the office Abel had held, and Master Salter - whilst alluding
to these in indignant terms as &ldquo;young varments,&rdquo; &ldquo;gallus-birds,&rdquo;
and so forth - was pleased to express his regret that the gentle and
trustworthy Abel had given up pig-minding for nursing.<br>
<br>
The pigs&rsquo; loss was the baby&rsquo;s gain.&nbsp; No tenderer or
more careful nurse could the little Jan have had.&nbsp; And he throve
apace.<br>
<br>
The windmiller took more notice of him than he had been wont to do of
his own children in their babyhood.&nbsp; He had never been a playful
or indulgent father, but he now watched with considerable interest the
child who, all unconsciously, was bringing in so much &ldquo;grist to
the mill.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
When the weather was not fine enough for them to be out of doors, Abel
would play with his charge in the round-house, and the windmiller never
drove him out of the mill, as at one time he would have done.&nbsp;
Now and then, too, he would pat the little Jan&rsquo;s head, and bestow
a word of praise on his careful guardian.<br>
<br>
It may be well, by-the-by, to explain what a round-house is.&nbsp; Some
of the brick or tower mills widen gradually and evenly to the base.&nbsp;
Others widen abruptly at the lowest story, which stands out all round
at the bottom of the mill, and has a roof running all round too.&nbsp;
The projection is, in fact, an additional passage, encircling the bottom
story of the windmill.&nbsp; It is the round-house.&nbsp; If you take
a pill-box to represent the basement floor of a tower-mill, and then
put another pill-box two or three sizes larger over it, you have got
the circular passage between the two boxes, and have added a round-house
to the mill.&nbsp; The round-house is commonly used as a kind of store-room.<br>
<br>
Abel Lake&rsquo;s windmill had no separate dwelling-house.&nbsp; His
grandfather had built the windmill, and even his father had left it
to the son to add a dwelling-house, when he should perhaps have extended
his resources by a bit of farming or some other business, such as windmillers
often add to their trade proper.&nbsp; But that calamity of the broken
sails had left Abel Lake no power for further outlay for many years,
and he had to be content to live in the mill.<br>
<br>
The dwelling-room was the inner part of the basement floor.&nbsp; Near
the door which led from this into the round-house was the ladder leading
to the next story, and close by that the opening through which the sacks
of grain were drawn up above.&nbsp; The story above the basement held
the millstones and the &ldquo;smutting&rdquo; machine, for cleaning
dirty wheat.&nbsp; The next above that held the dressing machine, in
which the bran was separated from the flour.&nbsp; In the next above
that were the corn-bins.&nbsp; To the next above that the grain was
drawn up from the basement in the first instance.&nbsp; The top story
of all held the machinery connected with the turning of the sails.&nbsp;
Ladders led from story to story, and each room had two windows on opposite
sides of the mill.<br>
<br>
Use is second nature, and all the sounds which haunt a windmill were
soon as familiar and as pleasant to the little Jan as if he had been
born a windmiller&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Through many a windy night he slept
as soundly as a sailor in a breeze which might disturb the nerves of
a land-lubber.&nbsp; And when the north wind blew keen and steadily,
and the chains jangled as the sacks of grist went upwards, and the millstones
ground their monotonous music above his head, these sounds were only
as a lullaby to his slumbers, and disturbed him no more than they troubled
his foster-mother, to whom the revolving stones ground out a homely
and welcome measure: &ldquo;Dai-ly bread, dai-ly bread, dai-ly bread.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
For another sign of his being a true child of the mill, his nurse Abel
anxiously watched.<br>
<br>
Though Abel preferred nursing to pig-minding, he had a higher ambition
yet, which was to begin his career as a windmiller.&nbsp; It was not
likely that he could be of use to his father for a year or two, and
the fact that he was of very great use to his mother naturally tended
to delay his promotion to the mill.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake was never allowed to say no to her husband, and she seemed
to be unable, and was certainly unwilling, to say it to her children.&nbsp;
Happily, her eldest child was of so sweet and docile a temper that spoiling
did him little harm; but even with him her inability to say no got the
mother into difficulties.&nbsp; She was obliged to invent excuses to
&ldquo;fub off,&rdquo; when she could neither consent nor refuse.<br>
<br>
So, when Abel used to cling about her, crying, &ldquo;Mother dear, when&rsquo;ll
I be put t&rsquo;help father in the mill?&nbsp; Do &rsquo;ee ask un
to let me come in now!&nbsp; I be able to sweep &rsquo;s well as Gearge.&nbsp;
I sweeps the room for thee,&rdquo; - she had not the heart or the courage
to say, &ldquo;I want thee, and thy father doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; but
she would take the boy&rsquo;s hand tenderly in hers, and making believe
to examine his thumbs with a purpose, would reply, &ldquo;Wait a bit,
love.&nbsp; Thee&rsquo;s a sprack boy, and a good un, but thee&rsquo;s
not rightly got the miller&rsquo;s thumb.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And thus it came about that Abel was for ever sifting bits of flour
through his finger and thumb, to obtain the required flatness and delicacy
which marks the latter in a miller born; and playing lovingly with little
Jan on the floor of the round-house, he would pass some through the
baby&rsquo;s fingers also, crying, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sift un, Janny! sift un!&nbsp; Thee&rsquo;s a miller&rsquo;s
lad, and thee must have a miller&rsquo;s thumb.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
BLACK AS SLANS. - VAIR AND VOOLISH. - THE MILLER AND HIS MAN.<br>
<br>
It was a great and important time to Abel when Jan learned to walk;
but, as he was neither precocious nor behindhand in this respect, his
biographer may be pardoned for not dwelling on it at any length.<br>
<br>
He had a charming demure little face, chiefly differing from the faces
of the other children of the district by an overwhelming superiority
in the matter of forehead.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake had had great hopes that he would differ in another respect
also.<br>
<br>
Most of the children of the neighborhood were fair.&nbsp; Not fair as
so many North-country children are, with locks of differing, but equally
brilliant, shades of gold, auburn, red, and bronze; but white-headed,
and often white-faced, with white-lashed inexpressive eyes, as if they
had been bleaching through several generations.<br>
<br>
Now, when the dark bright eyes of the little Jan first came to be of
tender interest with Mrs. Lake, she fully hoped, and constantly prophesied,
that he would be &ldquo;as black as a rook;&rdquo; a style of complexion
to which she gave a distinct preference, though the miller was fair
by nature as well as white by trade.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s eyes seemed conclusive.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Black as slans they be,&rdquo; said his foster-mother.&nbsp;
And slans meant sloe-berries where Mrs. Lake was born.<br>
<br>
An old local saying had something perhaps to do with her views: -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Lang and lazy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black and proud;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vair and voolish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little and loud.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Fair and foolish&rdquo; youngsters certainly abounded in the
neighborhood to an extent which justified a wish for a change.<br>
<br>
As to pride, meek Mrs. Lake was far from regarding it as a failing in
those who had any thing to be proud of, such as black hair and a possible
connection with the gentry.&nbsp; And fate having denied to her any
chance of being proud or aggressive on her own account, she derived
a curious sort of second-hand satisfaction from seeing these qualities
in those who belonged to her.&nbsp; It did to some extent console her
for the miller&rsquo;s roughness to herself, to hear him rating George.&nbsp;
And she got a sort of reflected dignity out of being able to say, &ldquo;My
maester&rsquo;s a man as will have his way.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But her hopes were not realized.&nbsp; That yellow into which the beefsteak
stage of Jan&rsquo;s infant complexion had faded was not destined to
deepen into gipsy hues.&nbsp; It gave place to the tints of the China
rose, and all the wind and sunshine on the downs could not tan, though
they sometimes burnt, his cheeks.&nbsp; The hair on his little head
became more abundant, but it kept its golden hue.&nbsp; His eyes remained
dark, - a curious mixture; for as to hair and complexion he was irredeemably
fair.<br>
<br>
The mill had at least one &ldquo;vair and voolish&rdquo; inmate, by
common account, though by his own (given in confidence to intimate friends)
he was &ldquo;not zuch a vool as he looked.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This was George Sannel, the miller&rsquo;s man.<br>
<br>
Master Lake had had a second hand in to help on that stormy night when
Jan made his first appearance at the mill; but as a rule he only kept
one man, whom he hired for a year at a time, at the mop or hiring fair
held yearly in the next town.<br>
<br>
George, or Gearge as he was commonly called, had been more than two
years in the windmill, and was looked upon in all respects as &ldquo;one
of the family.&rdquo;&nbsp; He slept on a truckle-bed in the round-house,
which, though of average size, would not permit him to stretch his legs
too recklessly without exposing his feet to the cold.<br>
<br>
For &ldquo;Gearge&rdquo; was six feet one and three-quarters in his
stockings.<br>
<br>
He had a face in some respects like a big baby&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He had
a turn-up nose, large smooth cheeks, a particularly innocent expression,
a forehead hardly worth naming, small dull eyes, with a tendency to
inflammation of the lids which may possibly have hindered the lashes
from growing, and a mouth which was generally open, if he were neither
eating nor sucking a &ldquo;bennet.&rdquo;&nbsp; When this countenance
was bathed in flour, it might be an open question whether it were improved
or no.&nbsp; It certainly looked both &ldquo;vairer&rdquo; and more
&ldquo;voolish!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
There is some evidence to show that he was &ldquo;lazy,&rdquo; as well
as &ldquo;lang,&rdquo; and yet he and Master Lake contrived to pull
on together.<br>
<br>
Either because his character was as childlike as his face, and because
- if stupid and slothful by nature - he was also of so submissive, susceptible,
and willing a temper that he disarmed the justest wrath; or because
he was, as he said, not such a fool as he looked, and had in his own
lubberly way taken the measure of the masterful windmiller to a nicety,
George&rsquo;s most flagrant acts of neglect had never yet secured his
dismissal.<br>
<br>
Indeed, it really is difficult to realize that any one who is lavish
of willingness by word can wilfully and culpably fail in deed.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I be a uncommon vool, maester, sartinly,&rdquo; blubbered George
on one occasion when the miller was on the point of turning him off,
as a preliminary step on the road to the &ldquo;gallus,&rdquo; which
Master Lake expressed his belief that he was &ldquo;sartin sure to come
to.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as he spoke, George made dismal daubs on his befloured
face with his sleeve, as he rubbed his eyes with his arm from elbow
to wrist.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sech a governor as you be, too!&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor
mother! she allus said I should come to no good, such a gawney as I
be!&nbsp; No more I shouldn&rsquo;t but for you, Master Lake, a-keeping
of me on.&nbsp; Give un another chance, sir, do &rsquo;ee!&nbsp; I be
mortal stoopid, sir, but I&rsquo;d work my fingers to the bwoan for
the likes of you, Master Lake!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
George stayed on, and though the very next time the windmiller was absent
his &ldquo;voolish&rdquo; assistant did not get so much as a toll-dish
of corn ground to flour, he was so full of penitence and promises that
he weathered that tempest and many a succeeding one.<br>
<br>
On that very eventful night of the storm, and of Jan&rsquo;s arrival,
George&rsquo;s neglect had risked a recurrence of the sail catastrophe.&nbsp;
At least if the second man&rsquo;s report was to be trusted.<br>
<br>
This man had complained to the windmiller that, during his absence with
the strangers, George, instead of doubling his vigilance now that the
men were left short-handed, had taken himself off under pretext of attending
to the direction of the wind and the position of the sails outside,
a most important matter, to which he had not, after all, paid the slightest
heed; and what he did with himself, whilst leaving the mill to its fate
and the fury of the storm, his indignant fellow-servant professed himself
&ldquo;blessed if he knew.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But few people are as grateful as they should be when informed of misconduct
in their own servants.&nbsp; It is a reflection on one&rsquo;s judgment.<br>
<br>
And unpardonable as George&rsquo;s conduct was, if the tale were true,
the words in which he couched his self-defence were so much more grateful
to the ears of the windmiller than the somewhat free and independent
style in which the other man expressed his opinion of George&rsquo;s
conduct and qualities, that the master took his servant&rsquo;s part,
and snubbed the informer for his pains.<br>
<br>
In justice to George, too, it should be said that he stoutly and repeatedly
denied the whole story, with many oaths and imprecations of horrible
calamities upon himself if he were lying in the smallest particular.&nbsp;
And this with reiteration so steady, and a countenance so guileless
and unmoved, as to contrast favorably with the face of the other man,
whose voice trembled and whose forehead flushed, either with overwhelming
indignation or with a guilty consciousness that he was bearing false
witness.<br>
<br>
Master Lake employed him no more, and George stayed on.<br>
<br>
But, for that matter, Master Lake&rsquo;s disposition was not one which
permitted him to profit by the best qualities of those connected with
him.&nbsp; He was a bit of a tyrant, and more than one man, six times
as clever, and ten times as hard-working as George, had gone when George
would have stayed, from crossing words with the windmiller.&nbsp; The
safety of the priceless sails, if all were true, had been risked by
the man he kept, and secured by the man he sent away, but Master Lake
was quite satisfied with his own decision.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I bean&rsquo;t so fond myself of men as is so mortal sprack and
fussy in a strange place,&rdquo; the miller observed to Mrs. Lake in
reference to this matter.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake had picked up several of her husband&rsquo;s bits of proverbial
wisdom, which she often flattered him by retailing to his face.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Too hot to hold, mostly,&rdquo; was her reply, in knowing tones.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, missus, so a be,&rdquo; said the windmiller.&nbsp; And
after a while he added, &ldquo;Gearge is slow, sartinly, mortal slow;
but Gearge is sure.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V.<br>
<br>
THE POCKET-BOOK AND THE FAMILY BIBLE. - FIVE POUNDS&rsquo; REWARD.<br>
<br>
Of the strange gentleman who brought Jan to the windmill, the Lakes
heard no more, but the money was paid regularly through a lawyer in
London.<br>
<br>
From this lawyer, indeed, Master Lake had heard immediately after the
arrival of his foster-son.<br>
<br>
The man of business wrote to say that the gentleman who had visited
the mill on a certain night had, at that date, lost a pocket-book, which
he thought might have been picked up at the mill.&nbsp; It contained
papers only valuable to the owner, and also a five-pound note, which
was liberally offered to the windmiller if he could find the book, and
forward it at once.<br>
<br>
Master Lake began to have a kind of reckless, gambling sort of feeling
about luck.&nbsp; Here would be an easily earned five pounds, if he
could but have the luck to find the missing property!&nbsp; That ten
shillings a week had come pretty easily to him.&nbsp; When all is said,
there <i>are</i> people into whose mouths the larks fall ready cooked!<br>
<br>
The windmiller looked inside the mill and outside the mill, and wandered
a long way along the chalky road with his eyes downwards, but he was
no nearer to the five-pound note for his pains.&nbsp; Then he went to
his wife, but she had seen nothing of the pocket-book; on which her
husband somewhat unreasonably observed that, &ldquo;A might a been zartin
<i>thee</i> couldn&rsquo;t help un!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He next betook himself to George, who was slowly, and it is to be hoped
surely, sweeping out the round-house.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Gearge, my boy,&rdquo; said the windmiller, in not too anxious
tones, &ldquo;have &rsquo;ee seen a pocket-book lying about anywheres?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
George leaned upon his broom with one hand, and with the other scratched
his white head.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What be a pocket-book, then, Master Lake?&rdquo; said he, grinning,
as if at his own ignorance.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s eerd of a pocket-book before now, thee vool, sure-ly!&rdquo;
said the impatient windmiller.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;se eerd of a pocket of hops, Master Lake,&rdquo; said
George, after an irritating pause, during which he still smiled, and
scratched his poll as if to stimulate recollection.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Book - book - book! pocket-<i>book!</i>&rdquo; shouted the miller.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If thee can&rsquo;t read, thee knows what a book is, thee gawney!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What a vool I be, to be sure!&rdquo; said George, his simple
countenance lighted up with a broader smile than before.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
knows a book, sartinly, Master Lake, I knows a book.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
one,&rdquo; George continued, speaking even slower than before, - &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
one inzide, sir, - a big un.&nbsp; On the shelf it be.&nbsp; A Vamly
Bible they calls un.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m sartin sure it be there,&rdquo;
he concluded, &ldquo;for a hasn&rsquo;t been moved since the last time
you christened, Master Lake.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The miller turned away, biting his lip hard, to repress a useless outburst
of rage, and George, still smiling sweetly, spun the broom dexterously
between his hands, as a man spins the water out of a stable mop.&nbsp;
Just before Master Lake had got beyond earshot, George lowered the broom,
and began to scratch his head once more.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be a proper
vool, sartinly,&rdquo; said he; and when the miller heard this, he turned
back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother allus said I&rsquo;d no more sense in my yead
than a dumbledore,&rdquo; George candidly confessed.&nbsp; And by a
dumbledore he meant a humble-bee.&nbsp; &ldquo;It do take me such a
time to mind any thing, sir.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, never mind, Gearge,&rdquo; said the miller; &ldquo;if thee&rsquo;s
slow, thee&rsquo;s sure.&nbsp; What do &rsquo;ee remember about the
book, now, Gearge?&nbsp; A don&rsquo;t mind giving thee five shilling,
if thee finds un, Gearge.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A had un down at the burying, I &rsquo;member quite well now,
sir.&nbsp; To put the little un&rsquo;s name in &rsquo;twas.&nbsp; I
thowt a hadn&rsquo;t been down zince christening, I be so stoopid sartinly.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What are you talking about, ye vool?&rdquo; roared the miller.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The book, sir, sartinly,&rdquo; said George, his honest face
beaming with good-humor.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Vamly Bible, Master Lake.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And as the windmiller went off muttering something which the Family
Bible would by no means have sanctioned, George returned chuckling to
a leisurely use of his broom on the round-house floor.<br>
<br>
Master Lake did not find the pocket-book, and after a day or two it
was advertised in a local paper, and a reward of five pounds offered
for it.<br>
<br>
George Sannel was seated one evening in the &ldquo;Heart of Oak&rdquo;
inn, sipping some excellent home-brewed ale, which had been warmed up
for his consumption in a curious funnel-shaped pipkin, when his long
lop-ears caught a remark made by the inn-keeper, who was reading out
bits from the local paper to a small audience, unable to read it for
themselves.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Five pound reward!&rdquo; he read.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lor massy!&nbsp;
There be a sum to be easily earned by a sharp-eyed chap with good luck
on &rsquo;s side.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And how then, Master Chuter?&rdquo; said George, pausing, with
the steaming mug half-way to his lips.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Haw, haw!&rdquo; roared the inn-keeper: &ldquo;you be a sharp-eyed
chap, too!&nbsp; Do &rsquo;ee think &rsquo;twould suit thee, Gearge?&nbsp;
Thee&rsquo;s a sprack chap, sartinly, Gearge!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Haw, haw, haw!&rdquo; roared the other members of the company,
as they slowly realized Master Chuter&rsquo;s irony at the expense of
the &ldquo;voolish&rdquo; Gearge.<br>
<br>
George took their rough banter in excellent part.&nbsp; He sipped his
beer, and grinned like a cat at his own expense.&nbsp; But after the
guffaws had subsided, he said, &ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s not told un about
that five pound yet, Master Chuter.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The curiosity of the company was by this time aroused, and Master Chuter
explained: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a gentleman by the name of Ford as is advertising
for a pocket-book, a seems to have lost on the downs, near to Master
Lake&rsquo;s windmill.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis thy way, too, Gearge, after
all.&nbsp; Thee must get up yarly, Gearge.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the yarly
bird catches the worm.&nbsp; And tell Master Lake from me, &rsquo;ll
have all the young varments in the place a driving their pigs up to
his mill, to look for the pocket-book, while they makes believe to be
minding their pigs.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Tis likely, too,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; And the two or three
very aged laborers in smocks, and one other lubberly boy, who composed
the rest of the circle, added, severally and collectively, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
likely, too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But, as George beat his way home over the downs in the dusk, he said
aloud, under cover of the roaring wind, and in all the security of the
open country, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Vive pound! vive pound!&nbsp; And a offered me vive shilling
for un.&nbsp; Master Lake, you be dog-ged cute; but Gearge bean&rsquo;t
quite such a vool as a looks.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
After a short time the advertisement was withdrawn.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI.<br>
<br>
GEORGE GOES COURTING. - GEORGE AS AN ENEMY. - GEORGE AS A FRIEND. -
ABEL PLAYS SCHOOL-MASTER. - THE LOVE-LETTER. - MOERDYK. - THE MILLER-MOTH.
- AN ANCIENT DITTY.<br>
<br>
One day George Sannel asked and obtained leave for a holiday.<br>
<br>
On the morning in question, he dressed himself in the cleanest of smocks,
greased his boots, stuck a bloody warrior, or dark-colored wallflower,
in his bosom, put a neatly folded, clean cotton handkerchief into his
pocket, - which, even if he did not use it, was a piece of striking
dandyism, - and scrubbed his honest face to such a point of cleanliness
that Mrs. Lake was almost constrained to remark that she thought he
must be going courting.<br>
<br>
George did not blush, - he never blushed, - but he looked &ldquo;voolish&rdquo;
enough to warrant the suspicion that his errand was a tender one, and
he had no other reason to give for his spruce appearance<br>
<br>
It was, perhaps, in his confusion that he managed to convey a mistaken
notion of the place to which he was going to Mrs. Lake.&nbsp; She was
under the impression that he went to the neighboring town, whereas he
went to one in an exactly opposite direction, and some miles farther
away.<br>
<br>
He went to the bank, too, which seems an unlikely place for tender tryst;
but George&rsquo;s proceedings were apt to be less direct than the simplicity
of his looks and speech would have led a stranger to suppose.&nbsp;
When he reached home, the windmiller and his family were going to bed,
for the night was still, and the mill idle.&nbsp; George betook himself
at once to where his truckle-bed stood in the round-house, and proceeded
to light his mill-candlestick, which was stuck into the wall.<br>
<br>
From the chink into which it was stuck he then counted seven bricks
downwards, and the seventh yielded to a slight effort and came out.&nbsp;
It was the door, so to speak, of a hole in the wall of the mill, from
which he drew a morocco-bound pocket-book.&nbsp; After an uneasy glance
over his shoulder, to make sure that the long dark shadow which stretched
from his own heels, and shifted with the draught in which the candle
flared, was not the windmiller creeping up behind him, he took a letter
out of the book and held it to the light as if to read it.&nbsp; But
he never turned the page, and at last replaced it with a sigh.&nbsp;
Then he put the pocket-book back into the hole, and pushed in after
it his handkerchief, which was tied round something which chinked as
he pressed it in.&nbsp; Then he replaced the brick, and went to bed.&nbsp;
He said nothing about the bank in the morning nor about the hole in
the mill-wall; and he parried Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s questions with gawky
grins and well-assumed bashfulness.<br>
<br>
Abel overheard his mother&rsquo;s jokes on the subject of &ldquo;Gearge&rsquo;s
young &rsquo;ooman,&rdquo; and they recurred to him when he and George
formed a curious alliance, which demands explanation.<br>
<br>
It was not solely because the windmiller looked favorably upon the little
Jan that he and Abel were now allowed to wander in the business parts
of the windmill, when they could not be out of doors, to an extent never
before permitted to the children.&nbsp; Part of the change was due to
a change in the miller&rsquo;s man.<br>
<br>
However childlike in some respects himself, George was not fond of children,
and he had hitherto seemed to have a particular spite against Abel.&nbsp;
He, quite as often as the miller, would drive the boy from the round-house,
and thwart his fancy for climbing the ladders to see the processes of
the different floors.<br>
<br>
Abel would have been happy for hours together watching the great stones
grind, or the corn poured by golden showers into the hopper on its way
to the stones below.&nbsp; Many a time had he crept up and hidden himself
behind a sack; but George seemed to have an impish ingenuity in discovering
his hiding-places, and would drive him out as a dog worries a cat, crying,
&ldquo;Come out, thee little varment!&nbsp; Master Lake he don&rsquo;t
allow thee hereabouts.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The cleverness of the miller&rsquo;s man in discovering poor Abel&rsquo;s
retreats probably arose from the fact that he had so rooted a dislike
for the routine work of his daily duties that he would rather employ
himself about the mill in any way than by attending to the mill-business,
and that his idleness and stupidity over work were only equalled by
his industry and shrewdness in mischief.<br>
<br>
Poor Abel had a dread of the great, gawky, mischievous-looking man,
which probably prevented his complaining to his mother of many a sly
pinch and buffet which he endured from him.&nbsp; And George took some
pains to keep up this wholesome awe of himself, by vague and terrifying
speeches, and by a trick of what he called &ldquo;dropping on&rdquo;
poor Abel in the dusk, with hideous grimaces and uncouth sounds.<br>
<br>
He once came thus upon Abel in an upper floor, and the boy fled from
him so hastily that he caught his foot in the ladder and fell headlong.&nbsp;
Though it must have been quite uncertain for some moments whether Abel
had not broken his neck, the miller&rsquo;s man displayed no anxiety.&nbsp;
He only clapped his hands upon his knees, in a sort of uncouth ecstasy
of spite, saying, &ldquo;Down a comes vlump, like a twoad from roost.&nbsp;
Haw, haw, haw!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Happily, Abel fell with little more damage to himself than the mill-cats
experienced in many such a tumble, as they fled before the tormenting
George.<br>
<br>
But, after all this, it was with no small surprise that Abel found himself
the object of attentions from the miller&rsquo;s man, which bore the
look of friendliness.<br>
<br>
At first, when George made civil speeches, and invited Abel to &ldquo;see
the stwones a-grinding,&rdquo; he only felt an additional terror, being
convinced that mischief was meant in reality.&nbsp; But, when days and
weeks went by, and he wandered unmolested from floor to floor, with
many a kindly word from George, and not a single cuff or nip, the sweet-tempered
Abel began to feel gratitude, and almost an affection, for his quondam
tormentor.<br>
<br>
George, for his part, had hitherto done some violence to his own feelings
by his constant refusal to allow Abel to help him to sweep the mill
or couple the sacks for lifting.&nbsp; He would have been only too glad
to put some of his own work on the shoulders of another, had it not
been for the vexatious thought that he would be giving pleasure by so
doing where he only wanted to annoy.&nbsp; And in his very unamiable
disposition malice was a stronger quality even than idleness.<br>
<br>
But now, when for some reason best known to himself, he wished to win
Abel&rsquo;s regard, it was a slight recompense to him for restraining
his love of tormenting that he got a good deal of work out of Abel at
odd moments when the miller was away.&nbsp; So well did he manage this,
that a marked improvement in the tidiness of the round-house drew some
praise from his master.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;ll be a sprack man yet, Gearge,&rdquo; said the windmiller,
encouragingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thee takes the broom into the corners now.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So I do,&rdquo; said George, unblushingly, &ldquo;so I do.&nbsp;
But lor, Master Lake, what a man you be to notice un!&rdquo;&nbsp; George&rsquo;s
kinder demeanor towards Abel began shortly after the coming of the little
Jan, and George himself accounted for it in the following manner: -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You do be kind to me now, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel, gratefully,
as he stood one day, with the baby in his arms, watching the miller&rsquo;s
man emptying a sack of grain into the hopper.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I likes to see thee with that babby, Abel,&rdquo; said George,
pausing in his work.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s a good boy, Abel, and
careful.&nbsp; I likes to do any thing for thee, Abel.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I wish I could do any thing for thee, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel;
&ldquo;but I be too small to help the likes of you, Gearge.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re small, you&rsquo;re sprack,&rdquo; said the miller&rsquo;s
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s a good scholar, too, Abel.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
be bound thee can read, now?&nbsp; And a poor gawney like I doesn&rsquo;t
know&rsquo;s letters.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I can read a bit, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel, with pride; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ve been at home a goodish while; but mother says she&rsquo;ll
send I to school again in spring, if the little un gets on well and
walks.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I wish I could read,&rdquo; said George, mournfully; &ldquo;but
time&rsquo;s past for me to go to school, Abel; and who&rsquo;d teach
a great lummakin vool like I his letters?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I would, Gearge, I would!&rdquo; cried Abel, his eyes sparkling
with earnestness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can teach thee thy letters, and by
the time thee&rsquo;s learned all I know, maybe I&rsquo;ll have been
to school again, and learned some more.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This was the foundation of a curious kind of friendship between Abel
and the miller&rsquo;s man.<br>
<br>
On the same shelf with the &ldquo;Vamly Bible,&rdquo; before alluded
to, was a real old horn-book, which had belonged to the windmiller&rsquo;s
grandmother.&nbsp; It was simply a sheet on which the letters of the
alphabet, and some few words of one syllable, were printed, and it was
protected in its frame by a transparent front of thin horn, through
which the letters could be read, just as one sees the prints through
the ground-glass of &ldquo;drawing slates.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
From this horn-book Abel labored patiently in teaching George his letters.&nbsp;
It was no light task.&nbsp; George had all the cunning and shrewdness
with which he credited himself; but a denser head for any intellectual
effort could hardly have been found for the seeking.&nbsp; Still they
struggled on, and as George went about the mill he might have been heard
muttering, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A B C G.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Cuss me for a vool!&nbsp; A B C <i>D</i>.&nbsp;
Why didn&rsquo;t they whop my letters into I when a was a boy?&nbsp;
A B C&rdquo; - and so persevering with an industry which he commonly
kept for works of mischief.<br>
<br>
One evening he brought home a newspaper from the Heart of Oak, and when
Mrs. Lake had taken the baby, he persuaded Abel to come into the round-house
and give him a lesson.&nbsp; Abel could read so much of it that George
was quite overwhelmed by his learning.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thee be&rsquo;s mortal larned, Abel, sartinly.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll
never read like thee,&rdquo; he added, despairingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drattle
th&rsquo; old witch; why didn&rsquo;t she give I some schooling?&rdquo;&nbsp;
He spoke with spiteful emphasis, and Abel, too well used to his rough
language to notice the uncivil reference to his mother, said with some
compassion, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Were you never sent to school then, Gearge?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They should ha&rsquo; kept me there,&rdquo; said George, self-defensively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I played moocher,&rdquo; he continued, - by which he meant truant,
- &ldquo;and then they whopped I, and a went home to mother, and she
kept un at home, the old vool!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, Gearge, thee must work hard, and I&rsquo;ll teach thee,
Gearge, I&rsquo;ll teach thee!&rdquo; said little Abel, proudly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And by-and-by, Gearge, we&rsquo;ll get a slate, and I&rsquo;ll
teach thee to write too, Gearge, that I will!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
George&rsquo;s small eyes gave a slight squint, as they were apt to
do when he was thinking profoundly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Abel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can thee read writing, my boy?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I think I could, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel, &ldquo;if &rsquo;twas
pretty plain.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Abel, my boy,&rdquo; said George, after a pause, with a broad
sweet smile upon his &ldquo;voolish&rdquo; face, &ldquo;go to the door
and see if the wind be rising at all; us mustn&rsquo;t forget th&rsquo;
old mill, Abel, with us larning.&nbsp; Sartinly not, Abel, mun.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Proud of the implied partnership in the care of the mill, Abel hastened
to the outer door.&nbsp; As he passed the inner one, leading into the
dwelling-room, he could hear his mother crooning a strange, drony, old
local ditty, as she put the little Jan to sleep.&nbsp; As Abel went
out, she was singing the first verse: -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The swallow twitters on the barn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rook is cawing on the tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the wood the ringdove coos,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my false love hath fled from
me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Abel opened the door, and looked out.&nbsp; One of those small white
moths known as &ldquo;millers&rdquo; went past him.&nbsp; The night
was still, - so utterly still that no sound of any sort whatever broke
upon the ear.&nbsp; In dead silence and loneliness stood the mill.&nbsp;
Even the miller-moth had gone; and a cat ran in by Abel&rsquo;s legs,
as if the loneliness without were too much for her.&nbsp; The sky was
gray.<br>
<br>
Abel went back to the round-house, where George was struggling to fix
the candlestick securely in the wall.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Cuss the thing!&rdquo; he exclaimed, whilst the skin of his face
took a mottled hue that was the nearest approach he ever made to a blush.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The tallow&rsquo;ve been a dropping, Abel, my boy.&nbsp; I think
&rsquo;twas the wind when you opened the door, maybe.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve
been a trying to fix un more firmly.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all, Abel; that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no signs of wind,&rdquo; said Abel.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
main quiet and unked too outside, Gearge.&nbsp; And I do think it be
like rain.&nbsp; There was a miller-moth, Gearge; do that mean any thing?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; &ldquo;I bean&rsquo;t
weatherwise myself, Abel.&nbsp; But if there be no wind, there be no
work, Abel; so us may go back to our larning.&nbsp; Look here, my boy,&rdquo;
he added, as Abel reseated himself on the grain-sack which did duty
as chair of instruction, and drawing, as he spoke, a letter forth to
the light; &ldquo;come to the candle, Abel, and see if so be thee can
read this, but don&rsquo;t tell any one I showed it thee, Abel.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not me, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel, warmly; and he added, - &ldquo;Be
it from thy young &rsquo;ooman, Gearge?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
No rustic swain ever simpered more consciously or looked more foolish
than George under this accusation, as he said, &ldquo;Be quiet, Abel,
do &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She be a good scholar, too!&rdquo; said Abel, looking admiringly
at the closely written sheet.<br>
<br>
George could hardly disguise the sudden look of fury in his face, but
he hastily covered up the letter with his hands in such a manner as
only to leave the first word on the page visible.&nbsp; There was a
deeply cunning reason for this clever manoeuvre.&nbsp; George held himself
to be pretty &ldquo;cute,&rdquo; and he reckoned that, by only showing
one word at a time, he could effectually prevent any attempt on Abel&rsquo;s
part to read the letter himself without giving its contents to George.&nbsp;
Like many other cunning people, George overreached himself.&nbsp; The
first word was beyond Abel&rsquo;s powers, though he might possibly
have satisfied George&rsquo;s curiosity on one essential point, by deciphering
a name or two farther on.&nbsp; But the clever George concluded that
he had boasted beyond his ability, so he put the letter away.&nbsp;
Abel tried hard at the one word which George exhibited, and gazed silently
at it for some time with a puzzled face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spell it, mun,
spell it!&rdquo; cried the miller&rsquo;s man, impatiently.&nbsp; It
was a process which he had seen to succeed, when a long word had puzzled
his teacher in the newspaper, before now.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;M O E R, mower; D Y K, dik,&rdquo; said Abel.&nbsp; But he looked
none the wiser for the effort.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mower dik!&nbsp; What be that?&rdquo; said George, peering at
the word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do&rsquo;ee think it be Mower dik, Abel?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I be sure,&rdquo; said Abel.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Or do &rsquo;ee think &rsquo;tis &rsquo;<i>My dear Dick</i>&rsquo;?&rdquo;
suggested George, anxiously, and with a sort of triumph in his tone,
as if that were quite what he expected.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an O, Gearge, that second letter.&nbsp;
Besides, twould be <i>My dear Gearge</i> to thee, thou knows.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Again the look with which the miller&rsquo;s man favored Abel was far
from pleasant.&nbsp; But he controlled his voice to its ordinary drawl
(always a little slower and more simple sounding, when he specially
meant mischief).<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So &rsquo;twould, Abel.&nbsp; So &rsquo;twould.&nbsp; What a
vool I be, to be sure!&nbsp; But give it to I now.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
look at it another time, Abel.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I be very sorry, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel, who had a consciousness
that the miller&rsquo;s man was ill-pleased in spite of his civility.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It be so long since I was at school, and it be such a queer word.&nbsp;
Do &rsquo;ee think she can have spelt un wrong, Gearge?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis likely she have,&rdquo; said George, regaining his
composure.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Abel!&nbsp; Abel!&nbsp; Abel!&rdquo; cried the mother from the
dwelling-room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come to bed, child!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Good-night, Gearge.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m main sorry to be so stupid,
Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel, and off he ran.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake was walking up and down, rocking the little Jan in her arms,
who was wailing fretfully.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I be puzzled to know what ails un,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake, in
answer to Abel&rsquo;s questions.&nbsp; &ldquo;He be quite in a way
tonight.&nbsp; But get thee to bed, Abel.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And though Abel begged hard to be allowed to try his powers of soothing
with the little Jan, Mrs. Lake insisted upon keeping the baby herself;
and Abel undressed, and crept into the press-bed.&nbsp; He fell asleep
in spite of a somewhat disturbed mind.&nbsp; That mysterious word and
George&rsquo;s evident displeasure worried him, and he was troubled
also by the unusual fretfulness of the little Jan, and the sound of
sorrow in his baby wail.&nbsp; His last waking thoughts were a strange
mixture, passing into stranger dreams.<br>
<br>
The word Moerdyk danced before his eyes, but brought no meaning with
it.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s cries troubled him, and with both there blended
the droning of the ancient plaintive ditty, which the foster-mother
sang over and over again as she rocked the child in her arms.&nbsp;
That wail of the baby&rsquo;s must have in some strange manner recalled
the first night of his arrival, when Abel found him wailing on the bed.&nbsp;
For the fierce eyes of the strange gentleman haunted Abel&rsquo;s dreams,
but in the face of the miller&rsquo;s man.<br>
<br>
The poor boy dreamed horribly of being &ldquo;dropped on&rdquo; by George,
with fierce black eyes added to the terrors of his uncouth grimaces.&nbsp;
He seemed to himself to fly blindly and vainly through the mill from
his tormentor, till George was driven from his thoughts by his coming
suddenly upon the little Jan, wailing as he really did wail, round whose
head a miller-moth was sailing slowly, and singing in a human voice:
-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The swallow twitters on the barn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rook is cawing on the tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the wood the ringdove coos,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my false love hath fled from
me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like tiny pipe of wheaten straw,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wren his little note doth swell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every living thing that flies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his true love doth fondly tell.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I alone am left to pine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sit beneath the withy tree;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For truth and honesty be gone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my false love hath fled from
me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII.<br>
<br>
ABEL GOES TO SCHOOL AGAIN. - DAME DATCHETT. - A COLUMN OF SPELLING.
- ABEL PLAYS MOOCHER. - THE MILLER&rsquo;S MAN CANNOT MAKE UP HIS MIND.<br>
<br>
Abel went to school again in the spring, and, though George would have
been better pleased had he forgotten the whole affair, he remembered
the word in George&rsquo;s young woman&rsquo;s love-letter which had
puzzled him; and never was a spelling-lesson set him among the M&rsquo;s
that he did not hope to come across it and to be able to demand the
meaning of Moerdyk from his Dame.<br>
<br>
Without the excuse of its coming in the column of spelling set by herself,
Abel dared not ask her to solve his puzzle; for never did teacher more
warmly resent questions which she was unable to answer than Dame Datchett.<br>
<br>
Abel could not fully make up his mind whether it should be looked up
among two-syllabled or three-syllabled words.&nbsp; He decided for the
former, and one day brought his spelling-book to George in the round-house.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a looking for that yere word, Gearge,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of Mo&rsquo;s, but it bean&rsquo;t
among &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Here they be.&nbsp; Words of two syllables; M,
Ma, Me, Mi; here they be, Mo.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Abel began to rattle
off the familiar column at a good rate, George looking earnestly over
his shoulder, and following the boy&rsquo;s finger as it moved rapidly
down the page.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mocking, Modern, Mohawk, Molar, Molly, Moment,
Money, Moping, Moral, Mortal, Moses, Motive, Movement.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stop a bit, mun,&rdquo; cried George; &ldquo;what do all they
words mean?&nbsp; They bothers me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I knows some of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Abel, &ldquo;and I asked
Dame Datchett about the others, but she do be so cross; and I thinks
some of &rsquo;em bothered she too.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s mocking.&nbsp;
I knows that.&nbsp; &rsquo;What&rsquo;s a modern, Dame?&rsquo; says
I.&nbsp; &rsquo;A muddle-headed fellow the likes of you,&rsquo; says
she.&nbsp; &rsquo;What&rsquo;s a mohawk, Dame?&rsquo; says I.&nbsp;
&rsquo;It&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll come to before long, ye young hang-gallus,&rsquo;
says she.&nbsp; I was feared on her, Gearge, I can tell &rsquo;ee; but
I tried my luck again.&nbsp; &rsquo;What&rsquo;s a molar, Dame?&rsquo;
says I.&nbsp; &rsquo;&lsquo;Tis a wus word than t&rsquo;other,&rsquo;
says she; &rsquo;and, if &rsquo;ee axes me any more voolish questions,
I&rsquo;ll break thee yead for &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;&nbsp; Do &rsquo;ee
think &rsquo;tis a very bad word, Gearge?&rdquo; added Abel, with a
rather indefensible curiosity.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I never heard un,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; And this was perhaps
decisive against the Dame&rsquo;s statement.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t
believe un neither.&nbsp; I think it bothered she.&nbsp; I believe &rsquo;tis
a genteel word for a man as catches oonts.&nbsp; They call oonts <i>moles</i>
in some parts, so p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps they calls a man as catches moles
a molar, as they calls a man as drives a mill a miller.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis likely too, Gearge,&rdquo; said Abel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well!&nbsp;
Molly we knows.&nbsp; And moment, and moping, and moral.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s moral?&rdquo; inquired George.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis what they put at the end of Vables, Gearge.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s Vables at the end of the spelling-book, and I&rsquo;ve
read un all.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the Wolf and the Lamb, and&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I knows now,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis like
the last verse of that song about the Harnet and the Bittle.&nbsp; Go
on, Abel.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mortal.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s swearing.&nbsp; Moses.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
in the Bible, Gearge.&nbsp; Motive.&nbsp; I thought I&rsquo;d try un
just once more.&nbsp; &rsquo;What&rsquo;s a motive, Dame?&rsquo; says
I.&nbsp; &rsquo;I&rsquo;ve got un here,&rsquo; says she, quite quiet-like.&nbsp;
But I seed her feeling under &rsquo;s chair, and I know&rsquo;d &rsquo;twas
for the strap, and I ran straight off, spelling-book and all, Gearge.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So thee&rsquo;ve been playing moocher, eh?&rdquo; said George,
with an unpleasant twinkle in his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll Master
Lake say to that?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee tell un, Gearge!&rdquo; Abel implored;
&ldquo;and, O Gearge! let I tell mother about the word.&nbsp; Maybe
she&rsquo;ve heard tell of it.&nbsp; Let I show her the letter, Gearge.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll read it for &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a scholard, is
mother.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
There was no mistaking now the wrath in George&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The
fury that is fed by fear blazes pretty strongly at all times.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee, Abel, my boy,&rdquo; said he, pinching Abel&rsquo;s
shoulder till he turned red and white with pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thee
ever speaks of that letter and that word to any mortal soul, I&rsquo;ll
tell Master Lake thee plays moocher, and I&rsquo;ll half kill thee myself.&nbsp;
Thee shall rue the day ever thee was born!&rdquo; he added, almost beside
himself with rage and terror.&nbsp; And as, after a few propitiating
words, Abel fled from the mill, George ground his hands together and
muttered, &ldquo;Motive!&nbsp; I wish the old witch had motived every
bone in thee body, or let me do &rsquo;t!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Master George Sannel was indeed a little irritable at this stage of
his career.&nbsp; Like the miller, he had had one stroke of good luck,
but capricious fortune would not follow up the blow.<br>
<br>
He had made five pounds pretty easily.&nbsp; But how to turn some other
property of which he had become possessed to profit for himself was,
after months of waiting, a puzzle still.<br>
<br>
He was well aware that his own want of education was the great hindrance
to his discovering for himself the exact worth of what he had got.&nbsp;
And to his suspicious nature the idea of letting any one else into his
secret, even to gain help, was quite intolerable.<br>
<br>
Abel seemed to be no nearer even to the one word that George had showed
him, after weeks of &ldquo;schooling,&rdquo; and George himself progressed
so slowly in learning to read that he was at times tempted to give up
the effort in despair.<br>
<br>
Of his late outburst against Abel he afterwards repented, as impolitic,
and was soon good friends again with his very placable teacher.<br>
<br>
Much of the time when he should have been at work did George spend in
&ldquo;puzzling&rdquo; over his position.&nbsp; Sometimes, as from an
upper window of the mill he saw the little Jan in Abel&rsquo;s arms,
he would mutter, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If a body were to kidnap un, would they advertise he, I wonders?&rdquo;
and after some consideration would shake his white head doubtfully,
saying, &ldquo;No, they wants to get rid of un, or they wouldn&rsquo;t
have brought un here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Happily for poor little Jan, the unscrupulous rustic rejected the next
idea which came to him as too doubtful of success.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I wonder if they&rsquo;d come down something handsome to them
as could tell &rsquo;em the young varmint was off their hands for good
and all.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould save un ten shilling a week.&nbsp; Ten
shilling a week!&nbsp; I heard un with my own ears.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
a kep&rsquo; un for five, if they&rsquo;d asked me.&nbsp; I wonders
now.&nbsp; Little uns like that does get stole by gipsies sometimes.&nbsp;
Varmer Smith&rsquo;s son were, and never heard on again.&nbsp; They
falls into a mill-race too sometimes.&nbsp; They be so venturesome.&nbsp;
But I doubt &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; Them as it belongs to might
be glad enough to get rid of un, and save their credit and their money
too by turning upon I after all.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The miller&rsquo;s man puzzled himself in vain.&nbsp; He could think
of no mode of action at once safe and certain of success.&nbsp; He did
not even know whether what he possessed had any value, or how or where
to make use of it.&nbsp; But a sort of dim hope of seeing his way yet
kept him about the mill, and he persevered in the effort to learn to
read, and kept his big ears open for any thing that might drop from
the miller or his wife to throw light on the history of Jan, with whom
his hopes were bound up.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, with a dogged patience, he bided his time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<br>
VISITORS AT THE MILL. - A WINDMILLER OF THE THIRD GENERATION. - CURE
FOR WHOOPING-COUGH. - MISS AMABEL ADELINE AMMABY. - DOCTORS DISAGREE.<br>
<br>
One of the earliest of Jan&rsquo;s remembrances - of those remembrances,
I mean, which remained with him when childhood was past - was of little
Miss Amabel, from the Grange, being held in the hopper of the windmill
for whooping cough.<br>
<br>
Jan was between three and four years old at this time, the idol of his
foster-mother, and a great favorite with his adopted brothers and sisters.&nbsp;
A quaint little fellow he was, with a broad, intellectual-looking face,
serious to old-fashionedness, very fair, and with eyes &ldquo;like slans.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He was standing one morning at Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s apron-string, his arms
clasped lovingly, but somewhat too tightly, round the waist of a sandy
kitten, who submitted with wonderful good-humor to the well-meant strangulation,
his black eyes intently fixed upon the dumplings which his foster-mother
was dexterously rolling together, when a strange footstep was heard
shuffling uncertainly about on the floor of the round-house just outside
the dwelling-room door.&nbsp; Mrs. Lake did not disturb herself.&nbsp;
Country folk were constantly coming with their bags of grist, and both
George and the miller were at hand, for a nice breeze was blowing, and
the mill ground merrily.<br>
<br>
After a few seconds, however, came a modest knock on the room-door,
and Mrs. Lake, wiping her hands, proceeded to admit the knocker.&nbsp;
She was a smartly dressed woman, who bore such a mass of laces and finery,
with a white woollen shawl spread over it, apparently with the purpose
of smothering any living thing there might chance to be beneath, as,
in Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s experienced eyes, could be nothing less than a
baby of the most genteel order.<br>
<br>
The manners of the nurse were most genteel also, and might have quite
overpowered Mrs. Lake, but that the windmiller&rsquo;s wife had in her
youth been in good service herself, and, though an early marriage had
prevented her from rising beyond the post of nursemaid, she was fairly
familiar with the etiquette of the nursery and of the servants&rsquo;
hall.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Good morning, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the nurse, who no sooner
ceased to walk than she began a kind of diagonal movement without progression,
in which one heel clacked, and all her petticoats swung, and the baby
who, head downwards, was snorting with gaping mouth under the woollen
coverlet, was supposed to be soothed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good morning, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll excuse my intruding&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not at all, mum,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake.&nbsp; By which she did
not mean to reject the excuse, but to disclaim the intrusion.<br>
<br>
When the nurse was not speaking, she kept time to her own rocking by
a peculiar click of her tongue against the roof of her mouth; and indeed
it sometimes mingled, almost confusingly, with her conversation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very obliging, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
said she, and, persuaded by Mrs. Lake, she took a seat.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
excuse me for asking a singular question, ma&rsquo;am, but <i>was your
husband&rsquo;s father and grandfather both millers?</i>&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They was, mum,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake.&nbsp; &ldquo;My husband&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s father built this mill where we now stands.&nbsp; It
cost him a deal of money, and he died with a debt upon it.&nbsp; My
husband&rsquo;s father paid un off; and he meant to have built a house,
mum, but he never did, worse luck for us.&nbsp; He allus says, says
he, - that&rsquo;s my husband&rsquo;s father, mum, - &rsquo;I&rsquo;ll
leave that to Abel,&rsquo; - that&rsquo;s my maester, mum.&nbsp; But
nine year ago come Michaelmas&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s story was here interrupted by a frightful outburst
of coughing from the unfortunate baby, who on the removal of the woollen
shawl presented an appearance which would have been comical but for
the sympathy its condition demanded.<br>
<br>
A very red and utterly shapeless little face lay, like a crushed beet-root,
in a mass of dainty laces almost voluminous enough to have dressed out
a bride.&nbsp; As a sort of crowning satire, the face in particular
was surrounded by a broad frill, spotted with bunches of pink satin
ribbon, and farther encased in a white satin hood of elaborate workmanship
and fringes.<br>
<br>
The contrast between the natural red of the baby&rsquo;s complexion
and its snowy finery was ludicrously suggestive of an over-dressed nigger,
to begin with; but when, in the paroxysms of its cough, the tiny creature&rsquo;s
face passed by shades of plum-color to a bluish black, the result was
appalling to behold.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s experienced ears were not slow to discover that the
child had got whooping-cough, which the nurse confessed was the case.&nbsp;
She also apologized for bringing in the baby among Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s
children, saying that she had &ldquo;thought of nothing but the poor
little chirrub herself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t name it, mum,&rdquo; replied the windmiller&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always say if children be to have things, they&rsquo;ll
have &rsquo;em; and if not, why they won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; A theory
which seems to sum up the views of the majority of people in Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s
class of life upon the spread of disease.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s coming to my poor
head,&rdquo; the nurse continued: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not so much as told
you who I am, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m nurse at the Grange, ma&rsquo;am,
with Mr. Ammaby and Lady Louisa.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve been in town, and
her ladyship&rsquo;s had the very best advice, and now we&rsquo;ve come
to the country for three months, but the dear child don&rsquo;t seem
a bit the better.&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ve been trying every thing, I&rsquo;m
sure.&nbsp; For any thing I heard of I&rsquo;ve tried, as well as what
the doctor ordered, and rubbing it with some stuff Lady Louisa&rsquo;s
mamma insisted upon, too, - even to a frog put into the dear child&rsquo;s
mouth, and drawed back by its legs, that&rsquo;s supposed to be a certain
cure, but only frightened it into a fit I thought it never would have
come out of, as well as fetching her ladyship all the way from her boudoir
to know what was the matter - which I no more dared tell her than fly.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; said the miller&rsquo;s wife; &ldquo;have
you tried goose-grease, mum?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an excellent thing.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Goose-grease, ma&rsquo;am, and an excellent ointment from the
bone-setter&rsquo;s at the toll-bar, which the butler paid for out of
his own pocket, knowing it to have done a world of good to his sister
that had a bad leg, besides being a certain cure for coughs, and cancer,
and consumption as well.&nbsp; And then the doctor&rsquo;s <i>imprecation</i>
on its little chest, night and morning, besides; but nothing don&rsquo;t
seem to do no good,&rdquo; said the poor nurse.&nbsp; &ldquo;And so,
ma&rsquo;am, - her ladyship being gone to the town, - thinks I, I&rsquo;ll
take the dear child to the windmill.&nbsp; For they do say, - where
I came from, ma&rsquo;am, - that if a miller, that&rsquo;s the son of
a miller, and the grandson of a miller, holds a child that&rsquo;s got
the whooping-cough in the hopper of the mill whilst the mill&rsquo;s
going, it cures them, however bad they be.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The reason of the nurse&rsquo;s visit being now made known, Mrs. Lake
called her husband, and explained to him what he was asked to do for
&ldquo;her ladyship&rsquo;s baby.&rdquo;&nbsp; The miller scratched
his head.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard my father say that his brother that drove a
mill in Cheshire had had it to do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I never
did it myself, ma&rsquo;am, nor ever see un done.&nbsp; And a hopper
be an ackerd place, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve ground many a cat
in this mill, from getting in the hopper at nights for warmth.&nbsp;
However,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I suppose I can hold the little lady
pretty tight.&rdquo;&nbsp; And finally, though with some unwillingness,
the miller consented to try the charm; being chiefly influenced by the
wish not to disoblige the gentlefolk at the Grange.<br>
<br>
The little Jan had watched the proceedings of the visitors with great
attention.&nbsp; During the poor baby&rsquo;s fit of coughing, he was
so absorbed that the sandy kitten slipped through his arms and made
off, with her tail as stiff as a sentry&rsquo;s musket; and now that
the miller took the baby into his arms, Jan became excited, and asked,
&ldquo;What daddy do with un?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The old-fashioned little piece!&rdquo; exclaimed the nurse, admiringly.&nbsp;
And Mrs. Lake added, &ldquo;Let un see the little lady, maester.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The miller held out the baby, and the nurse, removing a dainty handkerchief
edged with Valenciennes lace from its face, introduced it as &ldquo;Miss
Amabel Adeline Ammaby;&rdquo; and Mrs. Lake murmured, &ldquo;What a
lovely little thing!&rdquo;&nbsp; By which, for truth&rsquo;s sake,
it is to be hoped she meant the lace-edged handkerchief.<br>
<br>
In the exchange of civilities between the two women, the respective
children in their charge were admonished to kiss each other, - a feat
which was accomplished by Jan&rsquo;s kissing the baby very tenderly,
and with all his usual gravity.<br>
<br>
As this partly awoke the baby from a doze, its red face began to crease,
and pucker, and twist into various contortions, at which Jan gazed with
a sort of solemn curiosity in his black eyes.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stroke the little lady&rsquo;s cheeks, love,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Lake, irrepressibly proud of the winning ways and quaint grace which
certainly did distinguish her foster-child.<br>
<br>
Jan leaned forward once more, and passed his little hand softly down
the baby&rsquo;s face twice or thrice, as he was wont to stroke the
sandy kitten, as it slept with him, saying, &ldquo;Poor itta pussy!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a puss-cat, bless his little heart!&rdquo; said
the matter-of-fact nurse.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s little Miss Amabel
Adeline Ammaby.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Say it, love!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake, adding, to the nurse, &ldquo;he
can say any thing, mum.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Miss <i>Am - abel Ad - e - line Am - ma - by</i>,&rdquo; prompted
the nurse.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Amabel!&rdquo; said the little Jan, softly.&nbsp; But, after
this feat, he took a fit of childish reticence, and would say no more;
whilst, deeply resentful of the liberties Jan had taken, Miss Amabel
Adeline Ammaby twisted her features till she looked like a gutta-percha
gargoyle, and squalled as only a fretful baby can squall.<br>
<br>
She was calmed at last, however, and the windmiller took her once more
into his arms, and Mrs. Lake carrying Jan, they all climbed up the narrow
ladder to the next floor.<br>
<br>
Heavily ground the huge stones with a hundred and twenty revolutions
a minute, making the chamber shake as they went round.<br>
<br>
They made the nurse giddy.&nbsp; The simplest machinery has a bewildering
effect upon an unaccustomed person.&nbsp; So has going up a ladder;
which makes you feel much less safe in the place to which it leads you
than if you had got there by a proper flight of stairs.&nbsp; So - very
often - has finding yourself face to face with the accomplishment of
what you have been striving for, if you happen to be weak-minded.<br>
<br>
Under the combined influences of all these causes, the nurse listened
nervously to Master Lake, as he did the honors of the mill.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Those be the mill-stones, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Pretty fastish they
grinds, and they goes faster when the wind&rsquo;s gusty.&nbsp; Many
a good cat they&rsquo;ve ground as flat as a pancake from the poor gawney
beasts getting into the hopper.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; cried the nurse, now thoroughly alarmed, &ldquo;give
me the young lady back again.&nbsp; Deary, deary me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
no notion it was so dangerous.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t, sir! don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Tut, tut!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hold un safe, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
said the windmiller, who had all a man&rsquo;s dislike for shirking
at the last moment what had once been decided upon; and, as the nurse
afterwards expressed it, before she had time to scream, he had tucked
Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby&rsquo;s finery well round her, and had dipped
her into the hopper and out again.<br>
<br>
In that moment of suspense both the women had been silent, and the little
Jan had gazed steadily at the operation.&nbsp; As it safely ended, they
both broke simultaneously into words.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You might have knocked me down with a feather, mum!&rdquo; gasped
Mrs. Lake.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t look, mum.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
have looked to save my life.&nbsp; I turned my back.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d back &rsquo;ee allus to do the silliest thing as could
be done, missus,&rdquo; said the miller, who had a pleasant husbandly
way of commenting upon his wife&rsquo;s conversation to her disparagement,
when she talked before him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;As for me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the nurse said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
take my eyes off the dear child&rsquo;s hood.&nbsp; But move, - no thank
you, ma&rsquo;am, - I couldn&rsquo;t have moved hand or foot for a five-pound
note, paid upon the spot.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The baby got well.&nbsp; Whether the mill charm worked the cure, or
whether the fine fresh breezes of that healthy district made a change
for the better in the child&rsquo;s state, could not be proved.<br>
<br>
Nor were these the only possible causes of the recovery.<br>
<br>
The kind-hearted butler blessed the day when he laid out three and eightpence
in a box of the bone-setter&rsquo;s ointment, to such good purpose.<br>
<br>
Lady Louisa&rsquo;s mamma triumphantly hoped that it would be a lesson
to her dear daughter never again to set a London doctor&rsquo;s advice
(however expensive) above a mother&rsquo;s (she meant a grandmother&rsquo;s)
experience.<br>
<br>
The cook said, &ldquo;Goose-grease and kitchen physic for her!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And of course the doctor very properly, as well as modestly, observed
that &ldquo;he had confidently anticipated permanent beneficial results
from a persevering use of the embrocation.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And only to the nurse and the windmiller&rsquo;s family was it known
that Miss Amabel Adeline Ammaby had been dipped in the mill-hopper.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IX.<br>
<br>
GENTRY BORN. - LEARNING LOST. - JAN&rsquo;S BEDFELLOW. - AMABEL.<br>
<br>
After the nurse and baby had left the mill, Mrs. Lake showered extra
caresses upon the little Jan.&nbsp; It had given her a strange pleasure
to see him in contact with the Squire&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; She knew
enough of the manners and customs, the looks and the intelligence of
the children of educated parents, to be aware that there were &ldquo;makings&rdquo;
in those who were born heirs to developed intellects, and the grace
that comes of discipline, very different from the &ldquo;makings&rdquo;
to be found in the &ldquo;voolish&rdquo; descendants of ill-nurtured
and uneducated generations.&nbsp; She had no philosophical - hardly
any reasonable or commendable - thoughts about it.&nbsp; But she felt
that Jan&rsquo;s countenance and his &ldquo;ways&rdquo; justified her
first belief that he was &ldquo;gentry born.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She was proud of his pretty manners.&nbsp; Indeed, curiously enough,
she had recalled her old memories of nursery etiquette under a first-rate
upper nurse in &ldquo;her young days,&rdquo; to apply them to the little
Jan&rsquo;s training.<br>
<br>
Why she had not done this with her own children is a question that cannot
perhaps be solved till we know why so many soldiers, used for, it may
be, a quarter of a century to personal cleanliness as scrupulous as
a gentleman&rsquo;s, and to enforced neatness of clothes, rooms, and
general habits, take back to dirt and slovenliness with greediness when
they leave the service; and why many a nurse, whose voice and manners
were beyond reproach in her mistress&rsquo;s nursery, brings up her
own children in after life on the village system of bawling, banging,
threatening, cuddling, stuffing, smacking, and coarse language, just
as if she had never experienced the better discipline attainable by
gentle firmness and regular habits.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake had a small satisfaction in Jan&rsquo;s brief and limited
intercourse with so genteel a baby, and after it was all over she amused
herself with making him repeat the baby&rsquo;s very genteel (and as
she justly said &ldquo;uncommon&rdquo;) name.<br>
<br>
When Abel came back from school, he resumed his charge, and Mrs. Lake
went about other work.&nbsp; She was busy, and the nurse-boy put Jan
to bed himself.&nbsp; The sandy kitten waited till Jan was fairly established,
so as to receive her comfortably, and then she dropped from the roof
of the press-bed, and he cuddled her into his arms, where she purred
like a kettle just beginning to sing.<br>
<br>
Outside, the wind was rising, and, passing more or less through the
outer door, it roared in the round-house; but they were well sheltered
in the dwelling-room, and could listen complacently to the gusts that
whirled the sails, and made the heavy stones fly round till they shook
the roof.&nbsp; Just above the press-bed a candle was stuck in the wall,
and the dim light falling through the gloom upon the children made a
scene worthy of the pencil of Rembrandt, that great son of a windmiller.<br>
<br>
When Mrs. Lake found time to come to the corner where the old press-bed
stood, the kitten was asleep, and Jan very nearly so; and by them sat
Abel, watching every breath that his foster-brother drew.&nbsp; And,
as he watched, his trustworthy eyes and most sweet smile lighting up
a face to which his forefathers had bequeathed little beauty or intellect,
he might have been the guardian angel of the nameless Jan, scarcely
veiled under the likeness of a child.<br>
<br>
His mother smiled tenderly back upon him.&nbsp; He was very dear to
her, and not the less so for his tenderness to Jan.<br>
<br>
Then she stooped to kiss her foster-child, who opened his black eyes
very wide, and caught the sleeping kitten round the head, in the fear
that it might be taken from him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Tell Abel the name of pretty young lady you see today, love,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Lake.<br>
<br>
But Jan was well aware of his power over the miller&rsquo;s wife, and
was apt to indulge in caprice.&nbsp; So he only shook his head, and
cuddled the kitten more tightly than before.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Tell un, Janny dear.&nbsp; Tell un, there&rsquo;s a lovey!&rdquo;
said Mrs. Lake.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who did daddy put in the hopper?&rdquo;&nbsp;
But still Jan gazed at nothing in particular with a sly twinkle in his
black eyes, and continued to squeeze poor Sandy to a degree that can
have been little less agonizing than the millstone torture; and obdurate
he would probably have remained, but that Abel, bending over him, said,
&ldquo;Do &rsquo;ee tell poor Abel, Jan.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The child fixed his bright eyes steadily on Abel&rsquo;s well-loved
face for a few seconds, and then said quite clearly, in soft, evenly
accented syllables, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Amabel.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And the sandy kitten, having escaped with its life, crept back into
Jan&rsquo;s bosom and purred itself to rest.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER X.<br>
<br>
ABEL AT HOME. - JAN OBJECTS TO THE MILLER&rsquo;S MAN. - THE ALPHABET.
- THE CHEAP JACK. - &ldquo;PITCHERS.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Poor Abel was not fated to get much regular schooling.&nbsp; He particularly
liked learning, but the interval was all too brief between the time
when his mother was able to spare him from housework and the time when
his father began to employ him in the mill.<br>
<br>
George got more lazy and stupid, instead of less so, and though in some
strange manner he kept his place, yet when Master Lake had once begun
to employ his son, he found that he would get along but ill without
him.<br>
<br>
To Jan, Abel&rsquo;s being about the windmill gave the utmost satisfaction.&nbsp;
He played with his younger foster-brothers and sisters contentedly enough,
but his love for Abel, and for being with Abel, was quite another thing.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake, too, had no confidence in any one but Abel as a nurse for
her darling; the consequence of which was, that the little Jan was constantly
trotting at his foster-brother&rsquo;s heels through the round-house,
attempting valiant escalades on the ladders, and covering himself from
head to foot with flour in the effort to cultivate a miller&rsquo;s
thumb.<br>
<br>
One day Mrs. Lake, having sent the other children off to school, was
bent upon having a thorough cleaning-out of the dwelling-room, during
which process Jan was likely to be in her way; so she caught him up
in her arms and went to seek Abel in the round-house.<br>
<br>
She had the less scruple in availing herself of his services, that there
was no wind, and business was not brisk in the windmill.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Maester!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;can Abel mind Jan a bit?&nbsp;
I be going to clean the house.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the windmiller, &ldquo;Abel can mind un.&nbsp;
I be going to the village myself, but there&rsquo;s Gearge to start,
if so be the wind rises.&nbsp; And then if he want Abel, thee must take
the little un again.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sartinly I will,&rdquo; said his wife; and Abel willingly received
his charge and carried him off to play among the sacks.<br>
<br>
George joined them once, but Jan had a rooted and unconquerable dislike
to the miller&rsquo;s man, and never replied to his advances with any
thing more friendly than anger or tears.&nbsp; This day was no exception
to others in this respect; and after a few fruitless attempts to make
himself acceptable, in the course of which he trod on the sandy kitten&rsquo;s
tail, who ran up Jan&rsquo;s back and spat at her enemy from that vantage-ground,
George went off muttering in terms by no means complimentary to the
little Jan.&nbsp; Abel did his best to excuse the capricious child to
George, besides chiding him for his rudeness - with very little effect.&nbsp;
Jan dried his black eyes as the miller&rsquo;s man made off, but he
looked no more ashamed of himself than a good dog looks who has growled
or refused the paw of friendship to some one for excellent reasons of
his own.<br>
<br>
After George had gone, they played about happily enough, Jan riding
on Abel&rsquo;s back, and the sandy kitten on Jan&rsquo;s, in and out
among the corn-sacks, full canter as far as the old carved meal-chest,
and back to the door again.<br>
<br>
Poor Abel, with his double burden, got tired at last, and they sat down
and sifted flour for the education of their thumbs.&nbsp; Jan was pinching
and flattening his with a very solemn face, in the hope of attaining
to a miller&rsquo;s thumb by a shorter process than the common one,
when Abel suddenly said, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I tell thee what, then, Jan: &rsquo;tis time thee learned thy
letters.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll teach thee.&nbsp; Come hither.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan jumped up, thereby pitching the kitten headlong from his shoulders,
and ran to Abel, who was squatting by some spilled flour near a sack,
and was smoothing it upon the floor with his hands.&nbsp; Then very
slowly and carefully he traced the letter A in the flour, keenly watched
by Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s A,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say it, Jan.&nbsp;
A.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A,&rdquo; replied Jan, obediently.&nbsp; But he had no sooner
said it, than, adding hastily, &ldquo;Let Jan do it,&rdquo; he traced
a second A, slightly larger than Abel&rsquo;s, in three firm and perfectly
proportioned strokes.<br>
<br>
His moving finger was too much for the kitten&rsquo;s feelings, and
she sprang into the flour and pawed both the A&rsquo;s out of existence.<br>
<br>
Jan slapped her vigorously, and having smoothed the surface once more,
he drew A after A with the greatest rapidity, scrambling along sideways
like a crab, and using both hands indifferently, till the row stretched
as far as the flour would permit.<br>
<br>
Abel&rsquo;s pride in his pupil was great, and he was fain to run off
to call his mother to see the performances of their prodigy, but Jan
was too impatient to spare him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Let Jan do more!&rdquo; he cried.<br>
<br>
Abel traced a B in the flour.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s B, Jan,&rdquo;
said he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jan do it,&rdquo; replied Jan, confidently.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But say it,&rdquo; said his teacher, restraining him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say
B, Jan.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;B,&rdquo; said Jan, impatiently; and adding, &ldquo;Jan do it,&rdquo;
he began a row of B&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He hesitated slightly before making
the second curve, and looked at his model, after which he went down
the line as before, and quite as successfully.&nbsp; And the kitten
went down also, pawing out each letter as it was made, under the impression
that the whole affair was a game of play with herself.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There bean&rsquo;t a letter that bothers him,&rdquo; cried Abel,
triumphantly, to the no less triumphant foster-mother.<br>
<br>
Jan had, indeed, gone through the whole alphabet, with the utmost ease
and self-confidence; but his remembrance of the names of the letters
he drew so readily proved to be far less perfect than his representations
of them on the floor of the round-house.<br>
<br>
Abel found his pupil&rsquo;s progress hindered by the very talent that
he had displayed.&nbsp; He was so anxious to draw the letters that he
would not learn them, and Abel was at last obliged to make one thing
a condition of the other.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Say it then, Jan,&rdquo; he would cry, &ldquo;and then thee shall
make &rsquo;em.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake commissioned Abel to buy a small slate and pencil for Jan
at the village shop, and these were now the child&rsquo;s favorite toys.&nbsp;
He would sit quiet for any length of time with them.&nbsp; Even the
sandy kitten was neglected, or got a rap on its nose with the slate-pencil,
when to toy with the moving point had been too great a temptation to
be resisted.&nbsp; For a while Jan&rsquo;s taste for wielding the pencil
was solely devoted to furthering his learning to read.&nbsp; He drew
letters only till the day that the Cheap Jack called.<br>
<br>
The Cheap Jack was a travelling pedler, who did a good deal of business
in that neighborhood.&nbsp; He was not a pedler pure, for he had a little
shop in the next town.&nbsp; Nature had not favored him.&nbsp; He was
a hunchback.&nbsp; He was, or pretended to be, deaf.&nbsp; He had a
very ugly face, made uglier by dirt, above which he wore a mangy hair
cap.&nbsp; He sold rough pottery, cheap crockery and glass, mock jewelry,
low song-books, framed pictures, mirrors, and quack medicines.&nbsp;
He bought old bottles, bones, and rags.&nbsp; And what else he bought
or sold, or dealt with, was dimly guessed at by a few, but fully known
to none.<br>
<br>
Where he was born, what was his true name or age, whether on any given
occasion he was speaking less than lies, and what was the ultimate object
of his words and deeds, - at these things no one even guessed.&nbsp;
That his conscience was ever clean, that his dirty face once masked
no vile or petty plots for evil in the brain behind, that at some past
period he was a child, - these things it would have tasked the strongest
faith to realize.<br>
<br>
He was not so unpopular with children as the miller&rsquo;s man.<br>
<br>
The instinct of children is like the instinct of dogs, very true and
delicate as a rule.&nbsp; But dogs, from Cerberus downwards, are liable
to be biassed by sops.&nbsp; And four paper-covered sails, that twirl
upon the end of a stick as the wind blows, would warp the better judgment
of most little boys, especially (for a bargain is more precious than
a gift) when the thing is to be bought for a few old bones.<br>
<br>
Jan was a little afraid of the Cheap Jack, but he liked his whirligigs.&nbsp;
They went when the mill was going, and sometimes when the mill wouldn&rsquo;t
go, if you ran hard to make a breeze.<br>
<br>
But it so happened that the first day on which the Cheap Jack came round
after Jan had begun to learn his letters, he brought forth some wares
which moved Jan&rsquo;s feelings more than the whirligigs did.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Buy a nice picter, marm?&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack to Mrs. Lake,
who, with the best intentions not to purchase, felt that there could
be no harm in seeing what the man had got.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You shall have &rsquo;Joseph and his Bretheren&rsquo; cheap,&rdquo;
roared the hunchback, becoming more pressing as the windmiller&rsquo;s
wife seemed slow to be fascinated, and shaking &ldquo;Joseph and his
Brethren,&rdquo; framed in satin-wood, in her face, as he advanced upon
her with an almost threatening air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em?&nbsp;
Take &rsquo;Antony and Cleopatterer.&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sweet
picter.&nbsp; Too dear?&nbsp; Do you know what sech picters costs to
paint?&nbsp; Look at Cleopatterer&rsquo;s dress and the jewels she has
on.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t make a farthing on &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I gets daily
bread out of the other things, and only keeps the picters to oblige
one or two ladies of taste that likes to give their rooms a genteel
appearance.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The long disuse of such powers of judgment as she had, and long habit
of always giving way, had helped to convert Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s naturally
weak will and unselfish disposition into a sort of mental pulp, plastic
to any pressure from without.&nbsp; To men she invariably yielded; and,
poor specimen of a man as the Cheap Jack was, she had no fibre of personal
judgment or decision in the strength of which to oppose his assertions,
and every instant she became more and more convinced that wares she
neither wanted nor approved of were necessary to her, and good bargains,
because the man who sold them said so.<br>
<br>
The Cheap Jack was a knave, but he was no fool.&nbsp; In a crowded market-place,
or at a street door, no oilier tongue wagged than his.&nbsp; But he
knew exactly the moment when a doubtful bargain might be clinched by
a bullying tone and a fierce look on his dirty face, at cottage doors,
on heaths or downs, when the good wife was alone with her children,
and the nearest neighbor was half a mile away.<br>
<br>
No length of experience taught Mrs. Lake wisdom in reference to the
Cheap Jack.<br>
<br>
Each time that his cart appeared in sight she resolved to have nothing
to do with him, warned by the latest cracked jug, or the sugar-basin
which, after three-quarters of an hour wasted in chaffering, she had
beaten down to three-halfpence dearer than what she afterwards found
to be the shop price in the town.&nbsp; But proof to the untrained mind
is &ldquo;as water spilled upon the ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when the
Cheap Jack declared that she was quite free to look without buying,
and that he did not want her to buy, Mrs. Lake allowed him to pull down
his goods as before, and listened to his statements as if she had never
proved them to be lies, and was thrown into confusion and fluster when
he began to bully, and bought in haste to be rid of him, and repented
at leisure - to no purpose as far as the future was concerned.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; yelled the hunchback, as he waddled with horrible
swiftness after the miller&rsquo;s wife, as she withdrew into the mill;
&ldquo;which do you mean to have?&nbsp; <i>I</i> gets nothing on &rsquo;em,
whichever you takes, so please yourself.&nbsp; Take &rsquo;Joseph and
his Bretheren.&rsquo;&nbsp; The frame&rsquo;s worth twice the money.&nbsp;
Take the other, too, and I&rsquo;ll take sixpence off the pair, and
be out of pocket to please you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nothing to-day, thank you!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake, as loudly as
she could.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Got any other sort, you say?&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got all sorts, but some parties is so difficult to
please.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Wait a bit, wait a bit,&rdquo; he continued, as Mrs. Lake again
tried to make him (willing to) hear that she wanted none of his wares;
and, vanishing with the uncanny quickness common to him, he waddled
swiftly back again to his cart, and returned, before Mrs. Lake could
secure herself from intrusion, laden with a fresh supply of pictures,
the weight of which it seemed marvellous that he could support.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve got your choice, marm,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trouble to me to oblige a good customer.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s picters for you!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>Pitchers!</i>&rdquo; said Jan, admiringly, as he crept up
to them.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So they are, my little man.&nbsp; Now then, help your mammy to
choose.&nbsp; Most of these is things you can&rsquo;t get now, for love
nor money.&nbsp; Here you are, - &rsquo;Love and Beauty.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s a sweet thing.&nbsp; &rsquo;St Joseph,&rsquo; &rsquo;The
Robber&rsquo;s Bride,&rsquo; &rsquo;Child and Lamb,&rsquo; &rsquo;Melan-choly.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s an old&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Pitcher!&rdquo; exclaimed Jan once more, gazing at an old etching
in a dirty frame, which the Cheap Jack was holding in his hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pitcher, pitcher! let Jan look!&rdquo; he cried.<br>
<br>
It was of a water-mill, old, thatched, and with an unprotected wheel,
like the one in the valley below.&nbsp; Some gnarled willows stretched
across the water, whose trunks seemed hardly less time-worn and rotten
than the wheel below.&nbsp; This foreground subject was in shadow, and
strongly drawn, but beyond it, in the sunlight, lay a bit of delicate
distance, on the rising ground of which stood one of those small wooden
windmills known as Post-mills.&nbsp; An old woman and a child were just
coming into the shade, and passing beneath a wayside shrine.&nbsp; What
in the picture took Jan&rsquo;s fancy it is impossible to say, but he
gazed at it with exclamations of delight.<br>
<br>
The Cheap Jack saw that it was certain to be bought, and he raised the
price accordingly.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake felt the same conviction, and began to try at least to get
a good bargain.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a terr&rsquo;ble old frame,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There be no gold left on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; And no more there
was.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; screamed the Cheap Jack, with his hand
to his ear, and both a great deal too close to Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s face
to be pleasant.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis such an old frame,&rdquo; she shouted, &ldquo;and
the gold be all gone.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Old!&rdquo; cried the hunchback, scowling; &ldquo;who says I
sell old things?&nbsp; Every picter in that lot&rsquo;s brand new and
dirt cheap.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The gold be rubbed off,&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Lake in his ear.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Brighten it up, then,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gold
ain&rsquo;t paint; gold ain&rsquo;t paper; rub it up!&rdquo; and, suiting
the action to the word, he rubbed the dirty old frame vigorously with
the dirty sleeve of his smock.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t seem to brighten it, nohow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lake,
looking nervously round; but neither the miller nor George was to be
seen.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Real gold allus looks like this in damp weather,&rdquo; said
the Cheap Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hang it up in a warm room, dust it lightly
every morning with a dry handkerchief, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll come out
that shining you&rsquo;ll see your face in it.&nbsp; And when summer
comes, cover it up in yaller gauze to keep off the flies.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake looked wistfully at the place the Cheap Jack had rubbed, but
she had no redress, and saw no way out of her hobble but to buy the
picture.<br>
<br>
When the bargain was completed, the Cheap Jack fell back into his oiliest
manner; it being part of his system not only to bully at the critical
moment, but to be very civil afterwards, so as to leave an impression
so pleasant on the minds of his lady customers that they could hardly
do other than thank him for his promise to call again shortly with &ldquo;bargains
as good as ever.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Cheap Jack was a man of many voices.&nbsp; The softness of his parting
words to Mrs. Lake, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go three mile out of my road, ma&rsquo;am,
to call on a lady like you,&rdquo; had hardly died away, when he woke
the echoes of the plains by addressing his horse in a very different
tone.<br>
<br>
The Wiltshire carters and horses have a language between them which
falls darkly upon the ear of the unlearned therein; but the uncouth
yell which the Cheap Jack addressed to his beast was not of that dialect.&nbsp;
The sound he made on this occasion was not, Ga oot!&nbsp; Coom hedder!
or, There right! but the horse understood it.<br>
<br>
It is probable that it never heard the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s softer intonations,
for its protuberant bones gave a quiver beneath the scarred skin as
he yelled.&nbsp; Then its drooping ears pricked faintly, the quavering
forelegs were braced, one desperate jog of the tottering load of oddities,
and it set slowly and silently forward.<br>
<br>
The Cheap Jack did not follow his wares; he scrambled softly round the
mill, like a deformed cat, looking about him on all sides.&nbsp; Then
he made use of another sound, - a sharp, suggestive sound, whistled
between two of his fingers.<br>
<br>
Then he looked round again.<br>
<br>
No one appeared.&nbsp; The wheels of the distant cart scraped slowly
along the road, but this was the only sound the Cheap Jack heard.<br>
<br>
He whistled softly again.<br>
<br>
And as the cart took the sharp turn of the road, and was lost to sight,
the miller&rsquo;s man appeared, and the Cheap Jack greeted him in the
softest tone he had yet employed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, there you are, my
dear!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Mrs. Lake sat within, and looked ruefully at the damaged
frame, and wished that the master, or at least the man, had happened
to be at home.<br>
<br>
It is to be feared that our self-reproach for having done wrong is not
always so certain, or so keen, as our self-reproach for having allowed
ourselves to suffer wrong - in a bad bargain.<br>
<br>
Whether this particular picture was a bad bargain it is not easy to
decide.<br>
<br>
It was scandalously dear for its condition, and for what it had cost
the hunchback, but it was cheap for the pleasure it gave to the little
Jan.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XI.<br>
<br>
SCARECROWS AND MEN. - JAN REFUSES TO &ldquo;MAKE GEARGE.&rdquo; - UNCANNY.
- &ldquo;JAN&rsquo;S OFF.&rdquo;-THE MOON AND THE CLOUDS.<br>
<br>
The picture gave Jan great pleasure, but it proved a stumbling-block
on the road to learning.<br>
<br>
To &ldquo;make letters&rdquo; on his slate had been the utmost of his
ambition, and as he made them he learned them.&nbsp; But after the Cheap
Jack&rsquo;s visit his constant cry was, &ldquo;Jan make pitchers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And when Abel tried to confine his attention to the alphabet, he would,
after a most perfunctory repetition of a few letters that he knew, and
hap-hazard blunders over fresh ones, fling his arms round Abel&rsquo;s
neck and say coaxingly, &ldquo;Abel dear, make Janny <i>pitchers</i>
on his slate.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Abel&rsquo;s pictures, at the best, were of that style of wall decoration
dear to street boys.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Make a pitcher of a man,&rdquo; Jan would cry.&nbsp; And Abel
did so, bit by bit, to Jan&rsquo;s dictation.&nbsp; Thus &ldquo;Make&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; Make un round.&nbsp; Make two eyes.&nbsp; Make a nose.&nbsp;
Make a mouth.&nbsp; Make&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; Make&rsquo;s fingers,&rdquo;
etc.&nbsp; And, with some &ldquo;free-handling,&rdquo; Abel would strike
the five fingers off, one by one, in five screeching strokes of the
slate-pencil.&nbsp; But his art was conventional, and when Jan said,
&ldquo;Make un a miller&rsquo;s thumb,&rdquo; he was puzzled, and could
only bend the shortest of the five strokes slightly backwards to represent
the trade-mark of his forefathers.<br>
<br>
And when a little later Jan said one day, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a galley
crow, that is.&nbsp; <i>Now</i> make a pitcher of a MAN, Abel dear!&rdquo;
Abel found that the scarecrow figure was the limit of his artist powers,
and thenceforward it was Jan who &ldquo;made pitchers.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He drew from dawn to dusk upon the little slate which he wore tied by
a bit of string to the belt of his pinafore.&nbsp; He drew his foster-mother,
and Abel, and the kitten, and the clock, and the flower-pots in the
window, and the windmill itself, and every thing he saw or imagined.&nbsp;
And he drew till his slate was full on both sides, and then in very
primitive fashion he spat and rubbed it all out and began again.&nbsp;
And whenever Jan&rsquo;s face was washed, the two faces of his slate
were washed too; and with this companion he was perfectly happy and
constantly employed.<br>
<br>
Now it was Abel who gave the subjects for the pictures, and Jan who
made them, and it was good Abel also who washed the slate, and rubbed
the well-worn stumps of pencil to new points upon the round-house floor.<br>
<br>
They often went together to a mound at some little distance, where,
seated side by side, they &ldquo;made a mill&rdquo; upon the slate,
Jan drawing, and Abel dictating the details to be recorded.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Put in the window, Jan,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;and another,
and another, and another, and another.&nbsp; Now put the sails.&nbsp;
Now put the stage.&nbsp; Now put daddy by the door.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
On one point Jan was obstinate.&nbsp; He steadily refused to &ldquo;make
Gearge&rdquo; upon his slate in any capacity whatever.&nbsp; Perhaps
it was in this habit of constantly gazing at all things about him, in
order to commit them to his slate, which gave a strange, dreamy expression
to Jan&rsquo;s dark eyes.&nbsp; Perhaps it was sky-gazing, or the windmiller&rsquo;s
trick of watching the clouds, or perhaps it was something else, from
which Jan derived an erectness of carriage not common among the children
about him, and a quaint way of carrying his little chin in the air as
if he were listening to voices from a higher level than that of the
round-house floor.<br>
<br>
If he had lived farther north, he could hardly have escaped the suspicion
of uncanniness.&nbsp; He was strangely like a changeling among the miller&rsquo;s
children.<br>
<br>
To gratify that old whim of his about the red shawl, his doting foster-mother
made him little crimson frocks; and as he wandered over the downs in
his red dress and a white pinafore, his yellow hair flying in the breeze,
his chin up, his black eyes wide open, with slate in one hand, his pencil
in the other, and the sandy kitten clinging to his shoulder (for Jan
never lowered his chin to help her to balance herself), he looked more
like some elf than a child of man.<br>
<br>
He had queer, independent ways of his own, too; freaks, - not naughty
enough for severe punishment, but sufficiently out of the routine and
unexpected to cause Mrs. Lake some trouble.<br>
<br>
He was no sooner firmly established on his own legs, with the power
of walking, or rather toddling, independent of help, than he took to
making expeditions on the downs by himself.&nbsp; He would watch his
opportunity, and when his foster-mother&rsquo;s back was turned, and
the door of the round-house opened by some grist-bringer, he would slip
out and toddle off with a swiftness decidedly dangerous to a balance
so lately acquired.<br>
<br>
Sometimes Mrs. Lake would catch sight of him, and if her hands were
in the wash-tub, or otherwise engaged, she would cry to the nurse-boy,
&ldquo;Abel, he be off!&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s off.&rdquo;&nbsp; A comic
result of which was that Jan generally announced his own departure in
the same words, though not always loud enough to bring detection upon
himself.<br>
<br>
When his chance came and the door was open, he would pause for half
a moment on the threshold to say, in a tone of intense self-satisfaction,
&ldquo;He be off.&nbsp; Abel!&nbsp; Janny&rsquo;s off!&rdquo; and forthwith
toddle out as hard as he could go.&nbsp; As he grew older, he dropped
this form; but the elfish habit of appearing and disappearing at his
own whim was not cured.<br>
<br>
It was a puzzle as well as a care to Mrs. Lake.&nbsp; All her own children
had given trouble in their own way, - a way much the same with all of
them.&nbsp; They squalled for what they wanted, and, like other mothers
of her class, she served them whilst her patience lasted, and slapped
them when it came to an end.&nbsp; They clung about her when she was
cooking, in company with the cats, and she put tit-bits into their dirty
paws, and threw scraps to the clean paws of the cats, till the nuisance
became overwhelming, and she kicked the cats and slapped the children,
who squalled for both.&nbsp; They dirted their clothes, they squabbled,
they tore the gathers out of her dresses, and wailed and wept, and were
beaten with a hazel-stick by their father, and pacified with treacle-stick
by the mother; and so tumbled up, one after the other, through childish
customs and misdemeanors, almost as uniform as the steps of the mill-ladders.<br>
<br>
But the customs and misdemeanors of the foster-child were very different.<br>
<br>
His appetite to be constantly eating, drinking, or sucking - if it were
but a bennet or grass-stalk - was less voracious than that of the other
children.&nbsp; Mrs. Lake gave him Benjamin&rsquo;s share of treacle-stick,
but he has been known to give some of it away, and to exchange peppermint-drops
for a slate-pencil rather softer than his own.&nbsp; He would have had
Benjamin&rsquo;s share of &ldquo;bits&rdquo; from the cupboard, but
that the other children begged so much oftener, and Mrs. Lake was not
capable of refusing any thing to a steady tease.&nbsp; He could walk
the whole length of a turnip-field without taking a munch, unless he
were hungry, though even dear old Abel invariably exercised his jaws
upon a &ldquo;turmut.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he made himself ill with hedge-fruits
and ground-roots seldomer than any other member of the family.<br>
<br>
So far, Jan gave less trouble than the rest.&nbsp; But then he had a
spirit of enterprise which never misled them.&nbsp; From the effects
of this, Abel saved his life more than once.&nbsp; On one occasion he
pulled him out of the wash-tub, into which he had plunged head-foremost,
in a futile endeavor to blow soap-bubbles through a fragment of clay-pipe,
which he had picked up on the road, and which made his lips sore for
a week, besides nearly causing his death by drowning.<br>
<br>
From diving into the deepest recesses of the windmill it became hopeless
to try to hinder him, and when Abel was fairly taken into the business
Mrs. Lake relied upon his care for his foster-brother.&nbsp; And Jan
was wary and nimble, for his own part, and gave little trouble.&nbsp;
His great delight was to gaze first out of one window, and then out
of the opposite one; either blinking as the great sails drove by, as
if they would strike him in the face, or watching the shadows of them
invisible, as they passed like noon-day ghosts over the grass.<br>
<br>
His habit of taking himself off on solitary expeditions neither the
miller&rsquo;s hazel-stick nor Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s treacle-stick could
cure by force or favor.<br>
<br>
One November evening, just after tea, Jan disappeared, and the yellow
kitten also.&nbsp; When his bed-time came, Mrs. Lake sought him high
and low, and Abel went carefully, mill-candlestick in hand, through
every floor, from the millstones to the machinery, but in vain.&nbsp;
Neither he nor the kitten was to be found.<br>
<br>
It was when the kitten, in chase of her own tail, tumbled in sideways
through the round-house door, that Mrs. Lake remembered that Jan might
possibly have gone out, and she ran out after him.<br>
<br>
The air was chill and fresh, but not bitterly cold.&nbsp; The moon rode
high in the dark heavens, and a flock of small white clouds passed slowly
before its face and spread over the sky.&nbsp; The shadows of the driving
sails fell clearly in the moonlight, and flitted over the grass more
quickly than the clouds went by the moon.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake was not susceptible to effects of scenery, and she was thinking
of Jan.&nbsp; As she ran round the windmill, she struck her foot against
what proved to be his body, and, stooping, saw that he was lying on
his face.&nbsp; But when she snatched him up with a cry of terror, she
found that he was not dead, nor even hurt, but only weeping pettishly.<br>
<br>
In the first revulsion of feeling from her fright, she was rather disposed
to shake her recovered treasure, as a relief to her own excitement.&nbsp;
But Abel, whose first sight of Jan was as the light of the mill-candle
fell on his tear-stained face, said tenderly, &ldquo;What be amiss,
Janny?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jan can&rsquo;t make un,&rdquo; sobbed his foster-brother.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What can&rsquo;t Janny make?&nbsp; Tell Abel, then,&rdquo; said
the nurse-boy.<br>
<br>
Jan stuck his fists into his eyes, which were drying fast, and replied,
&ldquo;Jan can&rsquo;t make the moon and the clouds, Abel dear!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And Abel&rsquo;s candle being at that moment blown out by a gust of
wind, he could see Jan&rsquo;s slate and pencil lying at some distance
apart upon the short grass.<br>
<br>
On the dark ground of the slate he had made a round, white, full moon
with his soft slate-pencil, and had tried hard to draw each cloud as
it passed.&nbsp; But the rapid changes had baffled him, and the pencil-marks
were gray compared with the whiteness of the clouds and the brightness
of the moon, and the slate, though dark, was a mockery of the deep,
deep depths of the night-sky.<br>
<br>
And in his despair he had flung the slate one way and the pencil another,
and there they lay under the moonlight; and the sandy kitten, who could
see more clearly on this occasion than any one else, was dancing a fandango
upon poor Jan&rsquo;s unfinished sketch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XII.<br>
<br>
THE WHITE HORSE. - COMROGUES. - MOERDYK. - GEORGE CONFIDES IN THE CHEAP
JACK - WITH RESERVATION.<br>
<br>
When the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s horse came to the brow of the hill, it stopped,
and with drooping neck stood still as before.&nbsp; The Cheap Jack was
busy with George, and it was at no word from him that the poor beast
paused.&nbsp; It knew at what point to wait, and it waited.&nbsp; There
was little temptation to go on.&nbsp; The road down the hill had just
been mended with flints; some of these were the size of an average turnip,
and the hill was steep.&nbsp; So the old horse poked out his nose, and
stood almost dozing, till the sound of the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s shuffling
footsteps caused him to prick his ears, and brace his muscles for a
fresh start.<br>
<br>
The miller&rsquo;s man came also, who was sulky, whilst the Cheap Jack
was civil.&nbsp; He gave his horse a cut across the knees, to remind
him to plant his feet carefully among the sharp boulders; and then,
choosing a smooth bit by the side of the road, he and George went forward
together.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve took to picters, I see,&rdquo; said George, nodding
towards the cart.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So I have, my dear,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack; &ldquo;any thing
for a livelihood; an <i>honest</i> livelihood, you know, George.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he winked at the miller&rsquo;s man, who relaxed his sulkiness for
a guffaw.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve</i> had so little in my way lately, George,&rdquo;
the hunchback continued, looking sharply sideways up at his companion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sly business has been slack, my dear, eh?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But George made no answer, and the Cheap Jack, after relieving his feelings
by another cut at the horse, changed the subject.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sharp little brat of the miller&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
said he, alluding to Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;And he ain&rsquo;t much like
the others.&nbsp; Old-fashioned, too.&nbsp; Children mostly likes the
gay picters, and worrits their mothers for &rsquo;em, bless &rsquo;em!&nbsp;
But he picked out an ancient-looking thing, - came from a bankrupt pawnshop,
my dear, in a lot.&nbsp; I almost think I let it go too cheap; but that&rsquo;s
my failing.&nbsp; And a beggarly place like this ain&rsquo;t like London.&nbsp;
In London there&rsquo;s a place for every thing, my dear, and shops
for old goods as well as new, and customers too; and the older and dirtier
some things is, the more they fetches.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
There was a pause, for George did not speak; and the Cheap Jack, bent
upon amiability, repeated his remark, - &ldquo;A sharp little brat,
too!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What be &rsquo;ee harping on about him for?&rdquo; asked George,
suspiciously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knows what I knows about un, but that&rsquo;s
no business of yours.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You know about most things, my dear,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack,
flatteringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to get up very early that
catch you napping.&nbsp; But what about the child, George?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he ain&rsquo;t
none of the miller&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;ee that; and he ain&rsquo;t
the missus&rsquo;s neither.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What is he to <i>you</i>, my dear?&rdquo; asked the dwarf, curiously,
and, getting no answer, he went on: &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be useful in a
good many lines.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d not do bad in a circus, but he&rsquo;d
draw prime as a young prodigy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
George looked round, &ldquo;You be thinking of stealing <i>he</i> then,
as well as&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hush, my dear,&rdquo; said the dwarf.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, I
don&rsquo;t want him.&nbsp; But there was a good deal of snatching young
kids done in my young days; for sweeps, destitute orphans, juvenile
performers, and so on.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>He</i> wouldn&rsquo;t suit you,&rdquo; grinned George.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A comes of genteel folk, and a&rsquo;s not hard enough for how
you&rsquo;d treat un.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out there, George,&rdquo; said the dwarf.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Human beings is like &rsquo;osses; it&rsquo;s the genteelest
as stands the most.&nbsp; &rsquo;Specially if they&rsquo;ve been well
fed when they was babies.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At this point the Cheap Jack was interrupted by his horse stumbling
over a huge, jagged lump of flint, that, with the rest of the road-mending,
was a disgrace to a highway of a civilized country.&nbsp; A rate-payer
or a horse-keeper might have been excused for losing his temper with
the authorities of the road-mending department; but the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
wrath fell upon his horse.&nbsp; He beat him over the knees for stumbling,
and across the hind legs for slipping, and over his face for wincing,
and accompanied his blows with a torrent of abuse.<br>
<br>
What a moment that must have been for Balaam&rsquo;s ass, in which she
found voice to remonstrate against the unjust blows, which have, nevertheless,
fallen pretty thickly ever since upon her descendants and their fellow-servants
of ungrateful man!&nbsp; From how many patient eyes that old reproach,
of long service ill-requited, yet speaks almost as plainly as the voice
that &ldquo;rebuked the madness of the prophet!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Cheap Jack&rsquo;s white horse had a point of resemblance to the
&ldquo;genteel human beings&rdquo; of whom he had been speaking.&nbsp;
It had &ldquo;come of a good stock,&rdquo; and had seen better and kinder
days; and to it, also, in its misfortunes, there remained that nobility
of spirit which rises in proportion to the ills it meets with.&nbsp;
The poor old thing was miserably weak, and sore and jaded, and the flints
were torture.&nbsp; But it rallied its forces, gave a desperate struggle,
and got the cart safely to the bottom of the hill.&nbsp; Here the road
turned sharply, and the horse went on.&nbsp; But after a few paces it
stopped as before; this time in front of a small public-house, where
trembling, and bathed in perspiration, it waited for its master.<br>
<br>
The public-house was a small dark, dingy-looking hovel, with a reputation
fitted to its appearance.<br>
<br>
A dirty, grim-looking man nodded to the Cheap Jack and George as they
entered, and a girl equally dirty, but much handsomer, brought glasses
of spirits, to which the friends applied themselves, at the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
expense.&nbsp; George grew more sociable, and the Cheap Jack reproached
him with want of confidence in his friends.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so precious sharp, my dear,&rdquo; said the hunchback,
who knew well on what point George liked to be flattered, &ldquo;that
you overreaches yourself.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t complain - after all the
business we&rsquo;ve done together - that it&rsquo;s turned slack all
of a sudden.&nbsp; You says they&rsquo;re down on you, and that&rsquo;s
enough for me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t complain that you&rsquo;ve got your
own plans and keeps &rsquo;em as secret as the grave, but I says you&rsquo;ll
regret it.&nbsp; If you was a good scholar, George, you could do without
friends, you&rsquo;re so precious sharp.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re no scholar,
my dear, and you&rsquo;ll be let in yet, by a worse friend than Cheap
John.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
George so bitterly regretted his want of common learning, and the stupidity
which made him still slow to decipher print, and utterly puzzled by
writing, that the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s remarks told strongly.&nbsp; These,
and the conversation they had had on the hill, recalled to his mind
a matter which was still a mystery to the miller&rsquo;s man.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Look here, Jack,&rdquo; said he, leaning across the dirty little
table; &ldquo;if you be such a good scholar, what do M O E R D Y K spell?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Say it again, George,&rdquo; said the dwarf.&nbsp; But when,
after that, he still looked puzzled, George laughed long and loudly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You be a good scholar!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You be a
fine friend, too, for a iggerant man.&nbsp; If a can&rsquo;t tell the
first word of a letter, &rsquo;tis likely &rsquo;ee could read the whole,
too!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The first word of a <i>letter</i>, eh?&rdquo; said the dwarf.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The very first,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a
long way you&rsquo;d get in it, and stuck at the start!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Up in the corner, at the top, eh?&rdquo; said the dwarf.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So it be,&rdquo; said George, and he laughed no longer.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the name of a place, then,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack;
&ldquo;and it ain&rsquo;t to be expected I should know the names of
all the places in the world, George, my dear.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was a great triumph for the Cheap Jack, as George&rsquo;s face betrayed.&nbsp;
If George had trusted him a little more, he might have known the meaning
of the mysterious word years ago.&nbsp; The name of a place!&nbsp; The
place from which the letter was written.&nbsp; The place where something
might be learned about the writer of the letter, and of the gentleman
to whom it was written.&nbsp; For George knew so much.&nbsp; It was
written to a gentleman, and to a gentleman who had money, and who had
secrets; and, therefore, a gentleman from whom money might be got, by
interfering in his secrets.<br>
<br>
The miller&rsquo;s man was very ignorant and very stupid, in spite of
a certain low cunning not at all incompatible with gross ignorance.&nbsp;
He had no knowledge of the world.&nbsp; His very knowledge of malpractices
and mischief was confined to the evil doings of one or two other ill-conditioned
country lads like himself, who robbed their neighbors on dark nights,
and disposed of the spoil by the help of such men as the Cheap Jack
and the landlord of the public-house at the bottom of the hill.<br>
<br>
But by loitering about on that stormy night years ago, when he should
have been attending to the mill, he had picked up enough to show him
that the strange gentleman had no mind to have his proceedings as to
the little Jan generally known.&nbsp; This and some sort of traditional
idea that &ldquo;sharp,&rdquo; though penniless men had at times wrung
a great deal of money from rich people, by threatening to betray their
secrets, was the sole foundation of George&rsquo;s hopes in connection
with the letter.&nbsp; It was his very ignorance which hindered him
from seeing the innumerable chances against his getting to know any
thing important enough, even if he could use his information, to procure
a bribe.<br>
<br>
He had long given up the idea as hopeless, though he had kept the letter,
but it revived when the Cheap Jack solved the puzzle which Abel could
not explain, and George finally promised to let his friend read the
whole letter for him.&nbsp; He also allowed that it concerned Jan, or
that he supposed it to do so.&nbsp; He related Jan&rsquo;s history,
and confessed that he had picked up the letter, which was being blown
about near the mill, on the night of Jan&rsquo;s arrival.<br>
<br>
In this statement there was some truth, and some falsehood; for in the
opinion of the miller&rsquo;s man, if your own interest obliged you
to confide in a friend, it was at least wise to hedge the confidence
by not telling all the truth, or by qualifying it with lies.<br>
<br>
This mental process was, however, at least equally familiar to the Cheap
Jack, and he did not hesitate, in his own mind, to feel sure that the
letter had not been found, but stolen.&nbsp; In which he was farther
from the truth than if he had simply believed George.<br>
<br>
But then he was not in the neighborhood five years back, and, as it
happened, he had never heard of the lost pocket-book.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XIII.<br>
<br>
GEORGE AS A MONEYED MAN. - SAL. - THE &ldquo;WHITE HORSE.&rdquo;- THE
WEDDING. - THE WINDMILLER&rsquo;S WIFE FORGETS, AND REMEMBERS TOO LATE.<br>
<br>
Excitement, the stifling atmosphere of the public-house, and the spirits
he had drunk at his friend&rsquo;s expense, had somewhat confused the
brains of the miller&rsquo;s man by the time that the Cheap Jack rose
to go.&nbsp; George was, as a rule, sober beyond the wont of the rustics
of the district, chiefly from parsimony.&nbsp; When he could drink at
another man&rsquo;s expense, he was not always prudent.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve settled to go, my dear?&rdquo; said the dwarf,
as they stood together by the cart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Business being slack,
and parties unpleasantly suspicious, eh?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; said George, who felt very foolish, and
hoped himself successful in looking very wise; &ldquo;I be going to
set up for myself; I&rsquo;m tired of slaving for another man.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Quite right, too,&rdquo; said the dwarf; &ldquo;but all businesses
takes money, of which, my dear, I doesn&rsquo;t doubt you&rsquo;ve plenty.&nbsp;
You always took care of Number One, when you did business with Cheap
John.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At that moment, George felt himself a sort of embodiment of shrewd wisdom;
he had taken another sip from the glass, which was still in his hand,
and the only drawback to the sense of magnified cunning by which his
ideas seemed to be illumined was a less pleasant feeling that they were
perpetually slipping from his grasp.&nbsp; To the familiar idea of outwitting
the Cheap Jack he held fast, however.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It be nothin&rsquo; to thee what a have,&rdquo; he said slowly;
&ldquo;but a don&rsquo;t mind &rsquo;ee knowin&rsquo; so much, Jack,
because &rsquo;ee can&rsquo;t get at un; haw, haw!&nbsp; Not unless
&rsquo;ee robs the savings-bank.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The dwarf&rsquo;s eyes twinkled, and he affected to secure some pictures
that hung low, as he said carelessly, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Savings-banks be good places for a poor man to lay by in.&nbsp;
They takes small sums, and a few shillings comes in useful to a honest
man, George, my dear, if they doesn&rsquo;t go far in business.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Shillings!&rdquo; cried George, indignantly; &ldquo;pounds!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then, doubtful if he had not said too much, he added, &ldquo;A don&rsquo;t
so much mind &rsquo;ee knowing, Jack, because &rsquo;ee can&rsquo;t
get at &rsquo;em!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you&rsquo;re such a poor scholar, George,&rdquo;
said the Cheap Jack, turning round, and looking full at his friend;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re so sharp, but for that, my dear.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
think you counts the money over in your head till you makes it out more
than it is, now, eh?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A can keep things in my yead,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;better
than most folks can keep a book; I knows what I has, and what other
folks can&rsquo;t get at.&nbsp; I knows how I put un in.&nbsp; First,
the five-pound bill&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They must have stared to see you bring five pound in a lump,
George, my dear!&rdquo; said the hunchback.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it wise,
do you think?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Gearge bean&rsquo;t such a vool as a looks,&rdquo; replied the
miller&rsquo;s man.&nbsp; &ldquo;A took good care to change it first,
Cheap John, and a put it in by bits.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a clever customer, George,&rdquo; said his friend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, my dear?&nbsp; First, the five-pound bill, and then?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
George looked puzzled, and then, suddenly, angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
be that to you?&rdquo; he asked, and forthwith relapsed into a sulky
fit, from which the Cheap Jack found it impossible to rouse him.&nbsp;
All attempts to renew the subject, or to induce the miller&rsquo;s man
to talk at all, proved fruitless.&nbsp; The Cheap Jack insisted, however,
on taking a friendly leave.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Good-by, my dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;till the mop.&nbsp;
You knows my place in the town, and I shall expect you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The miller&rsquo;s man only replied by a defiant nod, which possibly
meant that he would come, but had some appearance of expressing only
a sarcastic wish that the Cheap Jack might see him on the occasion alluded
to.<br>
<br>
In obedience to a yell from its master, the white horse now started
forward, and it is not too much to say that the journey to town was
not made more pleasant for the poor beast by the fact that the Cheap
Jack had a good deal of long-suppressed fury to vent upon somebody.<br>
<br>
It was perhaps well for the bones of the white horse that, just as they
entered the town, the Cheap Jack brushed against a woman on the narrow
foot-path, who having turned to remonstrate in no very civil terms,
suddenly checked herself, and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Juggling Jack!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The dwarf started, and looked at the woman with a puzzled air.<br>
<br>
She was a middle-aged woman, in the earlier half of middle age; she
was shabbily dressed, and had a face that would not have been ill-looking,
but that the upper lip was long and cleft, and the lower one unusually
large.&nbsp; As the Cheap Jack still stared in silence, she burst into
a noisy laugh, saying, &ldquo;More know Jack the Fool than Jack the
Fool knows.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, even as she spoke, a gleam of recognition
suddenly spread over the hunchback&rsquo;s face, and, putting out his
hand, he said, &ldquo;Sal! <i>you</i> <i>here</i>, my dear?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The air of London don&rsquo;t agree with me just now,&rdquo;
was the reply; &ldquo;and how are you, Jack?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The country air&rsquo;s just beginning to disagree with me, my
dear,&rdquo; said the hunchback; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m glad to see you,
Sal.&nbsp; Come in here, my dear, and let&rsquo;s have a talk, and a
little refreshment.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The place of refreshment to which the dwarf alluded was another public-house,
the White Horse by name.&nbsp; There was no need to bid the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
white horse to pause here; he stopped of himself at every public-house;
nineteen times out of twenty to the great convenience of his master,
for which he got no thanks; the twentieth time the hunchback did not
want to stop, and he was lavish of abuse of the beast&rsquo;s stupidity
in coming to a standstill.<br>
<br>
The white horse drooped his soft white nose and weary neck for a long,
long time under the effigy of his namesake swinging overhead, and when
the Cheap Jack did come out, he seemed so preoccupied that the tired
beast got home with fewer blows than usual.<br>
<br>
He unloaded his cart mechanically, as if in a dream; but when he touched
the pictures, they seemed to awaken a fresh train of thought.&nbsp;
He stamped one of his little feet spitefully on the ground, and, with
a pretty close imitation of George&rsquo;s dialect, said bitterly, &ldquo;Gearge
bean&rsquo;t such a vool as a looks!&rdquo; adding, after a pause, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
do a deal to pay <i>him</i> off!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As he turned into the house, he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;Sal&rsquo;s
precious sharp; she allus was.&nbsp; And a fine woman, too, is Sal!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Not long after the incidents just related, it happened that business
called Mrs. Lake to the neighboring town.&nbsp; She seldom went out,
but a well-to-do aunt was sick, and wished to see her; and the miller
gave his consent to her going.<br>
<br>
She met the milk-cart at the corner of the road, and so was driven to
the town, and she took Jan with her.<br>
<br>
He had begged hard to go, and was intensely amused by all he saw.&nbsp;
The young Lakes were so thoroughly in the habit of taking every thing,
whether commonplace or curious, in the same phlegmatic fashion, that
Jan&rsquo;s pleasure was a new pleasure to his foster-mother, and they
enjoyed themselves greatly.<br>
<br>
As they were making their way towards the inn where they were to pick
up a neighbor, in whose cart they were to be driven home, their progress
was hindered by a crowd, which had collected near one of the churches.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake was one of those people who lead colorless lives, and are
without mental resources, to whom a calamity is almost delightful, from
the stimulus it gives to the imagination, and the relief it affords
to the monotony of existence.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&rdquo; she cried, peering through the crowd:
&ldquo;I wonder what it is.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis likely &rsquo;tis a man
in a fit now, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, or a cart upset, and every soul
killed, as it might be ourselves going home this very evening.&nbsp;
Dear, dear! &rsquo;tis a venturesome thing to leave home, too!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere they be! &rsquo;ere they be!&rdquo; roared a wave
of the crowd, composed of boys, breaking on Mrs. Lake and Jan at this
point.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the body, sure as death!&rdquo; murmured the windmiller&rsquo;s
wife; but, as she spoke, the street boys set up a lusty cheer, and Jan,
who had escaped to explore on his own account, came running back, crying,
-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the Cheap Jack, mammy! and he&rsquo;s been getting
married.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
If any thing could have rivalled the interest of a sudden death for
Mrs. Lake, it must have been such a wedding as this.&nbsp; She hurried
to the front, and was just in time to catch sight of the happy couple
as they passed down the street, escorted by a crowd of congratulating
boys.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well done, Cheap John!&rdquo; roared one.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
chose a beauty, you have,&rdquo; cried another.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
&rsquo;arf a &rsquo;ead taller, anyway,&rdquo; added a third.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Many happy returns of the day, Jack!&rdquo; yelled a fourth.<br>
<br>
Jan was charmed, and again and again he drew Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s attention
to the fact that it really <i>was</i> the Cheap Jack.<br>
<br>
But the windmiller&rsquo;s wife was staring at the bride.&nbsp; Not
merely because the bride is commonly considered the central figure of
a wedding-party, but because her face seemed familiar to Mrs. Lake,
and she could not remember where she had seen her.&nbsp; Though she
could remember nothing, the association seemed to be one of pain.&nbsp;
In vain she beat her brains.&nbsp; Memory was an almost uncultivated
quality with her, and, like the rest of her intellectual powers, had
a nervous, skittish way of deserting her in need, as if from timidity.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lake could sometimes remember things when she got into bed, but
on this occasion her pillow did not assist her; and the windmiller snubbed
her for making &ldquo;such a caddle&rdquo; about a woman&rsquo;s face
she might have seen anywhere or nowhere, for that matter; so she got
no help from him.<br>
<br>
And it was not till after the Cheap Jack and his wife had left the neighborhood,
that one night (she was in bed) it suddenly &ldquo;came to her,&rdquo;
as she said, that the dwarf&rsquo;s bride was the woman who had brought
Jan to the mill, on the night of the great storm.<br>
<br>

<br>
CHAPTER XIV.<br>
<br>
SUBLUNARY ART. - JAN GOES TO SCHOOL. - DAME DATCHETT AT HOME. - JAN&rsquo;S
FIRST SCHOOL SCRAPE. - JAN DEFENDS HIMSELF.<br>
<br>
Even the hero of a tale cannot always be heroic, nor of romantic or
poetic tastes.<br>
<br>
The wonderful beauty of the night sky and the moon had been fully felt
by the artist-nature of the child Jan; but about this time he took to
the study of a totally different subject, - pigs.<br>
<br>
It was the force of circumstances which led Jan to &ldquo;make pigs&rdquo;
on his slate so constantly, instead of nobler subjects; and it dated
from the time when his foster-mother began to send him with the other
children to school at Dame Datchett&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
Dame Datchett&rsquo;s cottage was the last house on one side of the
village main street.&nbsp; It was low, thatched, creeper-covered, and
had only one floor, and two rooms, - the outer room where the Dame kept
her school, and the inner one where she slept.&nbsp; Dame Datchett&rsquo;s
scholars were very young, and it is to be hoped that the chief objects
of their parents in paying for their schooling were to insure their
being kept safely out of the way for a certain portion of each day,
and the saving of wear and tear to clothes and shoes.&nbsp; It is to
be hoped so, because this much of discipline was to some extent accomplished.&nbsp;
As to learning, Dame Datchett had little enough herself, and was quite
unable to impart even that, except to a very industrious and intelligent
pupil.<br>
<br>
Her school appurtenances were few and simple.&nbsp; From one of them
arose Jan&rsquo;s first scrape at school.&nbsp; It was a long, narrow
blackboard, on which the alphabet had once been painted white, though
the letters were now so faded that the Dame could no longer distinguish
them, even in spectacles.<br>
<br>
The scrape came about thus.<br>
<br>
As he stood at the bottom of the little class which gathered in a semicircle
around the Dame&rsquo;s chair, his young eyes could see the faded letters
quite clearly, though the Dame&rsquo;s could not.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Say th&rsquo; alphabet, childern!&rdquo; cried Dame Datchett;
and as the class shouted the names of the letters after her, she made
a show of pointing to each with a long &ldquo;sallywithy&rdquo; wand
cut from one of the willows in the water-meadows below.&nbsp; She ran
the sallywithy along the board at what she esteemed a judicious rate,
to keep pace with the shouted alphabet, but, as she could not see the
letters, her tongue and her wand were not in accord.&nbsp; Little did
the wide-mouthed, white-headed youngsters of the village heed this,
but it troubled Jan&rsquo;s eyes; and when - in consequence of her rubbing
her nose with her disengaged hand - the sallywithy slipped to Q as the
Dame cried F, Jan brought the lore he had gained from Abel to bear upon
her inaccuracy.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a Q, not a F,&rdquo; he said, boldly and aloud.<br>
<br>
A titter ran through the class, and the biggest and stupidest boy found
the joke so overwhelming that he stretched his mouth from ear to ear,
and doubled himself up with laughter, till it looked as if his corduroy-breeched
knee were a turnip, and he about to munch it.<br>
<br>
The Dame dropped her sallywithy and began to feel under her chair.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Which be the young varment as said a F was a Q?&rdquo; she rather
unfairly inquired.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A didn&rsquo;t say a F was a Q&rdquo; -&nbsp; began Jan; but
a chorus of cowardly little voices drowned him, and curried favor with
the Dame by crying, &ldquo;Tis Jan Lake, the miller&rsquo;s son, missus.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And the big boy, conscious of his own breach of good manners, atoned
for it by officiously dragging Jan to Dame Datchett&rsquo;s elbow.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hold un vor me,&rdquo; said the Dame, settling her spectacles
firmly on her nose.<br>
<br>
And with infinite delight the great booby held Jan to receive his thwacks
from the strap which the Dame had of late years substituted for the
birch rod.&nbsp; And as Jan writhed, he chuckled as heartily as before,
it being an amiable feature in the character of such clowns that, so
long as they can enjoy a guffaw at somebody&rsquo;s expense, the subject
of their ridicule is not a matter of much choice or discrimination.<br>
<br>
After the first angry sob, Jan set his teeth and bore his punishment
in a proud silence, quite incomprehensible by the small rustics about
him, who, like the pigs of the district, were in the habit of crying
out in good time before they were hurt as a preventive measure.<br>
<br>
Strangely enough, it gave the biggest boy the impression that Jan was
&ldquo;poor-spirited,&rdquo; and unable to take his own part, - a temptation
to bully him too strong to be resisted.<br>
<br>
So when the school broke up, and the children were scattering over the
road and water-meads, the wide-mouthed boy came up to Jan and snatched
his slate from him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Give Jan his slate!&rdquo; cried Jan, indignantly.<br>
<br>
He was five years old, but the other was seven, and he held the slate
above his head.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And who be <i>Jan</i>, then, thee little gallus-bird?&rdquo;
said he, tauntingly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I be Jan!&rdquo; answered the little fellow, defiantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jan Lake, the miller&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Give I his slate!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s not a miller&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; said the other;
and the rest of the children began to gather round.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I be a miller&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; reiterated Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;ve got a miller&rsquo;s thumb, too;&rdquo; and he turned up
his little thumb for confirmation of the fact.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s not a miller&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; repeated the other,
with a grin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s child, thee is.&nbsp;
Master Lake&rsquo;s not thy vather, nor Mrs. Lake bean&rsquo;t thy mother.&nbsp;
Thee was brought to the mill in a sack of grist, thee was.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In saying which, the boy repeated a popular version of Jan&rsquo;s history.<br>
<br>
If any one had been present outside Dame Datchett&rsquo;s cottage at
that moment who had been in the windmill when Jan first came to it,
he would have seen a likeness so vivid between the face of the child
and the face of the man who brought him to the mill as would have seemed
to clear up at least one point of the mystery of his parentage.<br>
<br>
Pride and wrath convulsed every line of the square, quaint face, and
seemed to narrow it to the likeness of the man&rsquo;s, as, with his
black eyes blazing with passion, Jan flew at his enemy.<br>
<br>
The boy still held Jan&rsquo;s slate on high, and with a derisive &ldquo;haw!
haw!&rdquo; he brought it down heavily above Jan&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
But Jan&rsquo;s eye was quick, and very true.&nbsp; He dodged the blow,
which fell on the boy&rsquo;s own knees, and then flew at him like a
kitten in a tiger fury.<br>
<br>
They were both small and easily knocked over, and in an instant they
were sprawling on the road, and cuffing, and pulling, and kicking, and
punching with about equal success, except that the bigger boy prudently
roared and howled all the time, in the hope of securing some assistance
in his favor.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Dame Datchett!&nbsp; Missus!&nbsp; Murder!&nbsp; Yah!&nbsp; Boohoo!&nbsp;
The little varment be a throttling I.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But Mrs. Datchett was deaf.&nbsp; Also, she not unnaturally considered
that, in looking after &ldquo;the young varments&rdquo; in school-hours,
she fully earned their weekly pence, and was by no means bound to disturb
herself because they squabbled in the street.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Jan gradually got the upper hand of his lubberly and far from
courageous opponent, whose smock he had nearly torn off his back.&nbsp;
He had not spent any of his breath in calling for aid, but now, in reply
to the boy&rsquo;s cries for mercy and release, he shouted, &ldquo;What
be my name, now, thee big gawney?&nbsp; Speak, or I&rsquo;ll drottle
&rsquo;ee.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jan Lake,&rdquo; said his vanquished foe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me
go!&nbsp; Yah! yah!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Whose son be I?&rdquo; asked the remorseless Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Abel Lake&rsquo;s, the miller!&nbsp; Boohoo, boohoo!&rdquo; sobbed
the boy.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And what be this, then, Willum Smith?&rdquo; was Jan&rsquo;s
final question, as he brought his thumb close to his enemy&rsquo;s eye.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It be the miller&rsquo;s thumb thee&rsquo;s got, Jan Lake,&rdquo;
was the satisfactory answer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XV.<br>
<br>
WILLUM GIVES JAN SOME ADVICE. - THE CLOCK FACE. - THE HORNET AND THE
DAME. - JAN DRAWS PIGS. - JAN AND HIS PATRONS. - KITTY CHUTER. - THE
FIGHT. - MASTER CHUTER&rsquo;S PREDICTION.<br>
<br>
Jan went back to school.&nbsp; Though his foster-mother was indignant,
and ready to do battle both with Dame Datchett and with William Smith&rsquo;s
aunt (with whom, in lieu of parents, the boy lived), and though Abel
expressed his anxiety to go down and &ldquo;teach Willum to vight one
of his own zize,&rdquo; Jan steadily rejected their help, and said manfully,
&ldquo;Jan bean&rsquo;t feared of un.&nbsp; I whopped un, I did.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
So Mrs. Lake doctored his bruises, and sent him off to school again.&nbsp;
She yielded the more readily that she felt certain that the windmiller
would not take the child&rsquo;s part against the Dame.<br>
<br>
No further misfortune befell him.&nbsp; William, if loutish and a bit
of a bully on occasion, was not an ill-natured child; and, having a
turn for humor of a broad, unintellectual sort, he and Jan became rather
friendly on the common, but reprehensible ground of playing pranks,
which kept the school in a titter and the Dame in doubt.&nbsp; And,
if detected, they did not think a dose of the strap by any means too
high a price to pay for their fun.<br>
<br>
For William&rsquo;s sufferings under that instrument of discipline were
not to be measured by his doleful howlings and roarings, nor even by
his ready tears.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What be &rsquo;ee so voolish for as to say nothin&rsquo; when
her wollops &rsquo;ee?&rdquo; he asked of Jan, in a very friendly spirit,
one day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thee should holler as loud as &rsquo;ee can.&nbsp;
Them that hollers and cries murder she soon stops for, does Dame Datchett.&nbsp;
She be feared of their mothers hearing &rsquo;em, and comin&rsquo; after
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan could not lower himself to accept such base advice; but his superior
adroitness did much to balance the advantage William had over him, in
a less scrupulous pride.<br>
<br>
As to learning, I fear that, after the untoward consequences of his
zeal for the alphabet, Jan made no effort to learn any thing but cat&rsquo;s-cradle
from his neighbors.<br>
<br>
On one other occasion, indeed, he was somewhat over-zealous, and only
escaped the strap for his reward by a friendly diversion on the part
of his friend.&nbsp; The Dame had a Dutch clock in the corner of her
kitchen, the figures on the face of which were the common Arabic ones,
and not Roman.&nbsp; And as one of the few things the Dame professed
was to &ldquo;teach the clock,&rdquo; she would, when the figures had
been recited after the fashion in which her scholars shouted over the
alphabet, set those who had advanced to the use of slates to copy the
figures from the clock-face.<br>
<br>
Slowly and sorrowfully did William toil over this lesson.&nbsp; Again
and again did he rub out his ill-proportioned fives, with so greasy
a finger and such a superabundance of moisture as to make a sort of
puddle, into which he dug heavily, and broke two pencils.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A vive be such an akkerd vigger,&rdquo; he muttered, in reply
to Jan, who had looked up inquiringly as the second pencil snapped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill come aal right, though, when a dries.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It did dry, but any thing but right.&nbsp; Jan rubbed out the mass of
thick and blotted strokes, and when the Dame was not looking, he made
William&rsquo;s figures for him.&nbsp; Jan was behindhand in spelling,
but to copy figures was no difficulty to him.<br>
<br>
Having helped his friend thus, he pulled his smock, to draw attention
to his own slate.&nbsp; The other children wrote so slowly that time
had hung heavy on his hands; and, instead of copying the figures in
a row, he had made a drawing of the clock-face, with the figures on
it; but instead of the hands, he had put eyes, nose, and mouth, and
below the mouth a round gray blot, which William instantly recognized
for a portrait of the mole on Dame Datchett&rsquo;s chin.&nbsp; This
brilliant caricature so tickled him, that he had a fit of choking from
suppressed laughter; and he and Jan, being detected &ldquo;in mischief,&rdquo;
were summoned with their slates to the Dame&rsquo;s chair.<br>
<br>
William came off triumphant; but when the Dame caught sight of Jan&rsquo;s
slate, without minutely examining his work, she said, &ldquo;Zo thee&rsquo;s
been scraaling on thee slate, instead of writing thee figures,&rdquo;
and at once began to fumble beneath her chair.<br>
<br>
But William had slightly moved the strap with his foot, as he stood
with a perfectly unmoved and vacant countenance beside the Dame, which
made some delay; and as Mrs. Datchett bent lower on the right side of
her chair, William began upon the left a &ldquo;hum,&rdquo; which, with
a close imitation of the crowing of a cock, the grunting of a pig, and
the braying of a donkey, formed his chief stock of accomplishments.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Drat the thing!&nbsp; Where be un?&rdquo; said the Dame, endangering
her balance in the search.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;B-z-z-z-z!&rdquo; went William behind the chair; and he added,
<i>sotto voce</i>, to Jan, &ldquo;She be as dunch as a bittle.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At last the Dame heard, and looked round.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be that a harnet,
missus, do &rsquo;ee think?&rdquo; said William, with a face as guileless
as a babe&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
Dame Datchett rose in terror.&nbsp; William bent to look beneath her
chair for the hornet, and of course repeated his hum.&nbsp; As the hornet
could neither be found nor got rid of, the alarmed old lady broke up
the school, and went to lay a trap of brown sugar outside the window
for her enemy.&nbsp; And so Jan escaped a beating.<br>
<br>
But this and the story of his first fight are digressions.&nbsp; It
yet remains to be told how he took to drawing pigs.<br>
<br>
Dame Datchett&rsquo;s cottage was the last on one side of the street;
but it did not face the street, but looked over the water-meadows, and
the little river, and the bridge.<br>
<br>
As Jan sat on the end of the form, he could look through the Dame&rsquo;s
open door, the chief view from which was of a place close by the bridge,
and on the river&rsquo;s bank, where the pig-minders of the village
brought their pigs to water.&nbsp; Day after day, when the tedium of
doing nothing under Dame Datchett&rsquo;s superintendence was insufficiently
relieved to Jan&rsquo;s active mind by pinching &ldquo;Willum&rdquo;
till he giggled, or playing cat&rsquo;s-cradle with one of his foster-brothers,
did he welcome the sight of a flock of pigs with their keeper, scuttling
past the Dame&rsquo;s door, and rushing snorting to the stream.<br>
<br>
Much he envied the freedom of the happy pig-minder, whilst the vagaries
of the pigs were an unfailing source of amusement.<br>
<br>
The degree and variety of expression in a pig&rsquo;s eye can only be
appreciated by those who have studied pigs as Morland must have studied
them.&nbsp; The pertness, the liveliness, the humor, the love of mischief,
the fiendish ingenuity and perversity of which pigs are capable, can
be fully known to the careworn pig-minder alone.&nbsp; When they are
running away, - and when are they not running away? - they have an action
with the hind legs very like a donkey in a state of revolt.&nbsp; But
they have none of the donkey&rsquo;s too numerous grievances.&nbsp;
And if donkeys squealed at every switch, as pigs do, their undeserved
sufferings would have cried loud enough for vengeance before this.<br>
<br>
Jan&rsquo;s opportunities for studying pigs were good.&nbsp; As the
smallest and swiftest of the flock, his tail tightly curled, and indescribable
jauntiness in his whole demeanor, came bounding to the river&rsquo;s
brink, followed by his fellows, driving, pushing, snuffing, winking,
and gobbling, and lastly by a small boy in a large coat, with a long
switch, Jan was witness of the whole scene from Dame Datchett&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; And, as he sat with his slate and pencil before him, he
naturally took to drawing the quaint comic faces and expressive eyes
of the herd, and their hardly less expressive backs and tails; and to
depicting the scenes which took place when the pigs had enjoyed their
refreshment, and with renewed vigor led their keeper in twenty different
directions, instead of going home.&nbsp; Back, up the road, where he
could hardly drive them at the point of the switch a few hours before;
by sharp turns into Squire Ammaby&rsquo;s grounds, or the churchyard;
and helter-skelter through the water-meadows.<br>
<br>
The fame of Jan&rsquo;s &ldquo;pitcher-making&rdquo; had gone before
him to Dame Datchett&rsquo;s school by the mouths of his foster-brothers
and sisters, and he found a dozen little voices ready to dictate subjects
for his pencil.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Make a &rsquo;ouse, Janny Lake.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Make thee
vather&rsquo;s mill, Janny Lake.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Make a man.&nbsp;
Make Dame Datchett.&nbsp; Make the parson.&nbsp; Make the Cheap Jack.&nbsp;
Make Daddy Angel.&nbsp; Make Master Chuter.&nbsp; Make a oss - cow -
ship - pig!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But the popularity obtained by Jan&rsquo;s pigs soon surpassed that
of all his other performances.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Make pigs for I, Janny Lake!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Make pigs for
I, too!&rdquo; was a sort of whispering chorus that went on perpetually
under the Dame&rsquo;s nose.&nbsp; But when she found that it led to
no disturbance, that the children only huddled round the child Jan and
his slate like eager scholars round a teacher, Dame Datchett was wise
enough to be thankful that Jan possessed a power she had never been
able to acquire, - that he could &ldquo;keep the young varments quiet.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He be most&rsquo;s good&rsquo;s a monitor,&rdquo; thought the
Dame; and she took a nap, and Jan&rsquo;s genius held the school together.<br>
<br>
The children tried other influences besides persuasion.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jan Lake, I&rsquo;ve brought thee an apple.&nbsp; Draa out a
pig for I on a&rsquo;s slate.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan had a spirit of the most upright and honorable kind.&nbsp; He never
took an unfair advantage, and to the petty cunning which was &ldquo;Willum&rsquo;s&rdquo;
only idea of wisdom he seemed by nature incapable of stooping.&nbsp;
But in addition to, and alongside of, his artistic temperament, there
appeared to be in him no small share of the spirit of a trader.&nbsp;
The capricious, artistic spirit made him fitful in his use even of the
beloved slate; but, when he was least inclined to draw, the offer of
something he very much wanted would spur him to work; and in the spirit
of a true trader, he worked well.<br>
<br>
He would himself have made a charming study for a painter, as he sat
surrounded by his patrons, who watched him with gaping mouths of wonderment,
as his black eyes moved rapidly to and fro between the river&rsquo;s
brink and his slate, and his tiny fingers steered the pencil into cunning
lines which &ldquo;made pigs.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The very moral!&rdquo;
as William declared, smacking his corduroy breeches with delight.<br>
<br>
Sometimes Jan hardly knew that they were there, he was so absorbed in
his work.&nbsp; His eyes glowed with that strong pleasure which comes
in the very learning of any art, perhaps of any craft.&nbsp; Now and
then, indeed, his face would cloud with a different expression, and
in fits of annoyance, like that in which his foster-mother found him
outside the windmill, he would break his pencils, and ruthlessly destroy
sketches with which his patrons would have been quite satisfied.&nbsp;
But at other moments his face would twinkle with a very sunshine of
smiles, as he was conscious of having caught exactly the curve which
expressed obstinacy in this pig&rsquo;s back, or the air of reckless
defiance in that other&rsquo;s tail.<br>
<br>
And so he learned little or nothing, and improved in his drawing, and
kept the school quiet, and had always a pocket well filled with sweet
things, nails, string, tops, balls, and such treasures, earned by his
art.<br>
<br>
One day as he sat &ldquo;making pigs&rdquo; for one after another of
the group of children round him, a pig of especial humor having drawn
a murmur of delight from the circle, this murmur was dismally echoed
by a sob from a little maid on the outside of the group.&nbsp; It was
Master Chuter&rsquo;s little daughter, a pretty child, with an oval,
dainty-featured face, and a prim gentleness about her, like a good little
girl in a good little story.&nbsp; The intervening young rustics began
to nudge each other and look back at her.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Kitty Chuter be crying!&rdquo; they whispered.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What be amiss with &rsquo;ee, then, Kitty Chuter?&rdquo; said
Jan, looking up from his work; and the question was passed on with some
impatience, as her tears prevented her reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;What be amiss
with &rsquo;ee?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Janny Lake have never made a pig for I,&rdquo; sobbed the little
maid, with her head dolefully inclined to her left shoulder, and her
oval face pulled to a doubly pensive length.&nbsp; &ldquo;I axed my
vather to let me get him a posy, and a said I might.&nbsp; And I got
un some vine Bloody Warriors, and a heap of Boy&rsquo;s Love off our
big bush, that smelled beautiful.&nbsp; And vather says a can have some
water-blobs off our pond when they blows.&nbsp; But Tommy Green met
I as a was coming down to school, and a snatched my vlowers from me,
and I begged un to let me keep some of un, and a only laughed at me.&nbsp;
And I daren&rsquo;t go back, for I was late; and now I&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo;
to give Janny Lake to make a draft of a pig for I.&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
having held up for the telling of her tale, the little maid broke down
in fresh tears.<br>
<br>
Jan finished off the tail of the pig he was drawing with a squeak of
the pencil that might have come from the pig itself and, stuffing the
slate into its owner&rsquo;s hands, he ran up to Kitty Chuter and kissed
her wet cheeks, saying, &ldquo;Give I thee slate, Kitty Chuter, and
I&rsquo;ll make thee the best pig of all.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want nothing
from thee for &rsquo;t.&nbsp; And when school&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;ll
whop Tommy Green, if I sees him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And forthwith, without looking from the door for studies, Jan drew a
fat sow with her little ones about her; the other children clustering
round to peep, and crying, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ve made Kitty Chuter one,
two, three, vour, <i>vive</i> pigs!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah, and there be two more you can&rsquo;t see, because the old
un be lying on &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Six, seven!&rdquo; William counted; and he assisted the calculation
by sticking up first a thumb and then a forefinger as he spoke.<br>
<br>
Some who had not thought half a ball of string, or a dozen nails as
good as new, too much to pay for a single pig drawn on one side of their
slates, and only lasting as long as they could contrive to keep the
other side in use without quite smudging that one, were now disposed
to be dissatisfied with their bargains.&nbsp; But as the school broke
up, and Tom Green was seen loitering on the other side of the road,
every thing was forgotten in the general desire to see Jan carry out
his threat, and &ldquo;whop&rdquo; a boy bigger than himself for bullying
a little girl.<br>
<br>
Jan showed no disposition to shirk, and William acted as his friend,
and held his slate and book.<br>
<br>
Success is not always to the just, however; and poor Jan was terribly
beaten by his big opponent, though not without giving him some marks
of the combat to carry away.<br>
<br>
Kitty Chuter wept bitterly for Jan&rsquo;s bloody nose; but he comforted
her, saying, &ldquo;Never mind, Kitty; if he plagues thee again, &rsquo;ll
fight un again and again, till I whops he.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But his valor was not put to the proof, for Tommy Green molested her
no more.<br>
<br>
Jan washed his face in the water-meadows, and went stout-heartedly home,
where Master Lake beat him afresh, as he ironically said, &ldquo;to
teach him to vight young varments like himself instead of minding his
book.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But upon Master Chuter, of the Heart of Oak, the incident made quite
a different impression.&nbsp; He was naturally pleased by Jan&rsquo;s
championship of his child, and, added to this, he was much impressed
by the sketch on the slate.&nbsp; It was, he said, the &ldquo;living
likeness&rdquo; of his own sow; and, as she had seven young pigs, the
portrait was exact, allowing for the two which Jan had said were out
of sight.<br>
<br>
He gave Kitty a new slate, and kept the sketch, which he showed to all
in-comers.&nbsp; He displayed it one evening to the company assembled
round the hearth of the little inn, and took occasion to propound his
views on the subject of Jan&rsquo;s future life.<br>
<br>
(Master Chuter was fond of propounding his views, - a taste which was
developed by always being sure of an audience.)<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to me,&rdquo; said Master Chuter, speaking
of Jan, &ldquo;who the boy be.&nbsp; It be no fault of his&rsquo;n if
he&rsquo;s a fondling.&nbsp; And one thing&rsquo;s sure enough.&nbsp;
Them that left him with Master Lake left something besides him.&nbsp;
There was that advertisement, - you remember that about the five-pound
bill in the paper, Daddy Angel?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, Master Chuter,&rdquo; said Daddy Angel; &ldquo;after
the big storm, five year ago.&nbsp; Sartinly, Master Chuter.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Was it ever found, do ye think?&rdquo; said Master Linseed, the
painter and decorator.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It must have been found,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;but
I bean&rsquo;t so sure about it&rsquo;s having been given up, the notice
was in so long.&nbsp; And whoever did find un must have found un at
once.&nbsp; But what I says is, five-pound notes lost as easy as that
comes from where there&rsquo;s more of the same sort.&nbsp; And, if
Master Lake be paid for the boy, he can &rsquo;fford to &rsquo;prentice
him when his time comes.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ve boys enough of his own to
take to the mill, and Jan do seem to have such an uncommon turn for
drawing things out, I&rsquo;d try him with painting and varnishing,
if he was mine.&nbsp; And I believe he&rsquo;d come to signs, too!&nbsp;
Look at that, now!&nbsp; It be small, and the boy&rsquo;ve had no paint
to lay on, but there&rsquo;s the sign of the Jolly Sow for you, as natteral
as life.&nbsp; You know about signs, Master Linseed,&rdquo; continued
the landlord.&nbsp; For there was a tradition that the painter could
&ldquo;do picture-signs,&rdquo; though he had only been known to renew
lettered ones since he came to the neighborhood.&nbsp; &ldquo;Master
Lake should &rsquo;prentice him with you when he&rsquo;s older,&rdquo;
Master Chuter said in conclusion.<br>
<br>
But Master Linseed did not respond warmly.&nbsp; He felt it a little
beneath his dignity as a sign-painter to jump at the idea, though the
rest of the company assented in a general murmur.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Scrawling on a slate,&rdquo; the painter and decorator began
- and at this point he paused, after the leisurely customs of the district,
to light his pipe at the leaden-weighted candlestick which stood near;
and then, as his hearers sat expectant, but not impatient, proceeded:
&ldquo;Scrawling on a slate is one thing, Master Chuter: painting and
decorating&rsquo;s another.&nbsp; Painting&rsquo;s a trade; and not
rightly to be understood by them that&rsquo;s not larned it, nor to
be picked up by all as can scrawl a line here and a line there, as the
whim takes &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Take oak-graining,&rdquo; - and here Master
Linseed paused again, with a fine sense of effect, - &ldquo;who&rsquo;d
ever think of taking a comb to it as didn&rsquo;t know?&nbsp; And for
the knots, I&rsquo;ve worked &rsquo;em - now with a finger and now a
thumb - over a shutter-front till it looked that beautiful the man it
was done for telled me himself, - &rsquo;I&rsquo;d rather,&rsquo; says
he, &rsquo;have &rsquo;em as you&rsquo;ve done &rsquo;em than the real
thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; But young hands is nowhere with the knots.&nbsp;
They puts &rsquo;em in too thick.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The company said, &ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; in a tone of unbroken assent,
for Master Linseed was understood to have &ldquo;come from a distance,&rdquo;
and to &ldquo;know a good deal.&rdquo;&nbsp; But an innkeeper stands
above a painter and decorator anywhere, and especially on his own hearth,
and Master Chuter did not mean to be put down.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I suppose old hands were young uns once, Master Linseed,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;and if the boy were never much at oak-graining, I&rsquo;d
back him for sign-painting, if he were taught.&nbsp; Why, the pigs he
draas out, look you.&nbsp; I could cut &rsquo;em up, and not a piece
missing; not a joint, nor as much as would make a pound of sausages.&nbsp;
And if a draas pigs, why not osses, why not any other kind?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; said the company.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I be thinking,&rdquo; continued Master Chuter, &ldquo;of a gentlemen
as draad out that mare of my father&rsquo;s that ran in the mail.&nbsp;
You remember the coaches, Daddy Angel?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, Master Chuter.&nbsp; Between Lonnon and Exeter a ran.&nbsp;
Fine days at the Heart of Oak, then, Master Chuter.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He weren&rsquo;t a sign-painter, that I knows on.&nbsp; A were
somethin&rsquo; more in the gentry way,&rdquo; said Master Chuter, not,
perhaps, quite without malice in the distinction.&nbsp; &ldquo;He were
what they calls in genteel talk a&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Artis&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Master Linseed, removing his pipe,
to supply the missing word with a sense of superiority.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, not a artis&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Master Chuter, &ldquo;though
it do begin with a A, too.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t a artis&rsquo;
he was, &rsquo;twas a&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ammytoor,&rdquo; said the travelled sign-painter.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That be it,&rdquo; said the innkeeper.&nbsp; &ldquo;A ammytoor.&nbsp;
And he was short of money, I fancy, and so &rsquo;twas settled a should
paint this mare of my father&rsquo;s to set against the bill.&nbsp;
And a draad and a squinted at un, and a squinted at un and a draad,
and laid the paint on till the pictur&rsquo; looked all in a mess, and
then he took un away to vinish.&nbsp; But when a sent it home, I thought
my vather would have had the law of un.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blessed if a
hadn&rsquo;t given the mare four white feet, and shoulders that wouldn&rsquo;t
have pulled a vegetable cart; and she near-wheeler of the mail!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d lay a pound bill Jan Lake would a done her ever so much better,
for as young a hand as a is, if a&rsquo;d squinted at her as long.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, well, Master Chuter,&rdquo; said the painter and decorator,
rising to go, &ldquo;let the boy draw pigs and osses for his living.&nbsp;
And I wish he may find paint as easy as slate-pencil.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Master Linseed&rsquo;s parting words produced upon the company that
somewhat unreasonable depression which such ironical good wishes are
apt to cause; but they only roused the spirit of contradiction in Master
Chuter, and heightened his belief in Jan&rsquo;s talents more than any
praise from the painter could have done.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pretty caddle about giving a boy&rsquo;s due!&rdquo;
said the innkeeper.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I knows the points of a oss, and
the makings of a pig, if I bean&rsquo;t a sign-painter.&nbsp; And, mark
my words, the boy Jan &rsquo;ull out-paint Master Linseed yet.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Master Chuter spoke with triumph in his tone, but it was the triumph
of delivering his sentiments to unopposing hearers.<br>
<br>
There were moments of greater triumph to come, of which he yet wotted
not, when the sevenfold fulfilment of his prediction should be past
dispute, and attested from his own walls by more lasting monuments of
Jan&rsquo;s skill than the too perishable sketch which now stood like
a text for the innkeeper on the mantelpiece of the Heart of Oak.<br>
<br>

CHAPTER XVI.<br>
<br>
THE MOP. - THE SHOP. - WHAT THE CHEAP JACK&rsquo;S WIFE HAD TO TELL.
- WHAT GEORGE WITHHELD.<br>
<br>
A mop is a local name for a hiring-fair, at which young men and women
present themselves to be hired as domestic servants or farm laborers
for a year.&nbsp; It was at a mop that the windmiller had hired George,
and it was at that annual festival that his long service came to an
end.&nbsp; He betook himself to the town, where the fair was going on,
not with any definite intention of seeking another master, but from
a variety of reasons: partly for a holiday, and to &ldquo;see the fun;&rdquo;
partly to visit the Cheap Jack, and hear what advice he had to give,
and to learn what was in the letter; partly with the idea that something
might suggest itself in the busy town as a suitable investment for his
savings and his talents.&nbsp; At the worst, he could but take another
place.<br>
<br>
The sun shone brightly on the market-place as George passed through
it.&nbsp; The scene was quaint and picturesque.&nbsp; Booths, travelling
shows, penny theatres, quack doctors, tumblers, profile cutters, exhibitors
and salesmen of all sorts, thronged the square, and overflowed into
a space behind, where some houses had been burnt down and never rebuilt;
whilst round the remains of the market cross in the centre were grouped
the lads and lasses &ldquo;on hire.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girls were smartly
dressed, and the young men in snowy smocks, above which peeped waistcoats
of gay colors, looked in the earlier part of the day so spruce, that
it was as lamentable to see them after the hours of beer-drinking and
shag tobacco-smoking which followed, as it was to see what might have
been a neighborly and cheerful festival finally swamped in drunkenness
and debauchery.<br>
<br>
George&rsquo;s smock was white, and George&rsquo;s waistcoat was red,
and he had made himself smart enough, but he did not linger amongst
his fellow-servants at the Cross.&nbsp; He hurried through the crowd,
nodding sheepishly in answer to a shower of chaff and greetings, and
made his way to the by-street where the Cheap Jack had a small dingy
shop for the sale of coarse pottery.&nbsp; Some people were spiteful
enough to hint that the shop-trade was of much less value to him than
the store-room attached, where the goods were believed to be not all
of one kind.<br>
<br>
The red bread-pans, pipkins, flower-pots, and so forth, were grouped
about the door with some attempt at effective display, and with cheap
prices marked in chalk upon their sides.&nbsp; The window was clean,
and in it many knick-knacks of other kinds were mixed with the smaller
china ware.&nbsp; And, when George entered the shop, the hunchback&rsquo;s
wife was behind the counter.&nbsp; Like Mrs. Lake, he paused to think
where he could have seen her before; the not uncomely face marred by
an ugly mouth, in which the upper lip was long and cleft, and the lower
lip large and heavy, seemed familiar to him.&nbsp; He was still beating
his brains when the Cheap Jack came in.<br>
<br>
George had been puzzled that the woman&rsquo;s countenance did not seem
new to him, and he was puzzled and disturbed also that the expression
on the face of the Cheap Jack was quite new.&nbsp; Whatever the hunchback
had in his head, however, he was not unfriendly in his manner.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Good morning, George, my dear!&rdquo; he cried, cheerfully; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
seen my missus before, eh, George?&rdquo;&nbsp; George was just about
to say no, when he remembered that he had seen the woman, and when and
where.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Dreadful night that was, Mr. Sannel!&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
wife, with a smile on her large mouth.&nbsp; George assented, and by
the hospitable invitation of the newly married couple he followed them
into the dwelling part of the house, trying as he did so to decide upon
a plan for his future conduct.<br>
<br>
Here at last was a woman who could probably tell all that he wanted
to know about the mystery on which he had hoped to trade, and - the
Cheap Jack had married her.&nbsp; If any thing could be got out of the
knowledge of Jan&rsquo;s history, the Cheap Jack, and not George, would
get it now.&nbsp; The hasty resolution to which George came was to try
to share what he could not keep entirely to himself.&nbsp; He flattered
himself he could be very civil, and - he had got the letter.<br>
<br>
It proved useful.&nbsp; George was resolved not to show it until he
had got at something of what the large-mouthed woman had to tell; and,
as she wanted to see the letter, she made a virtue of necessity, and
seemed anxious to help the miller&rsquo;s man to the utmost of her power.<br>
<br>
The history of her connection with Jan&rsquo;s babyhood was soon told,
and she told it truthfully.<br>
<br>
Five years before her marriage to the Cheap Jack, she was a chambermaid
in a small hotel in London, and &ldquo;under notice to leave.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Why - she did not deem it necessary to tell George.&nbsp; In this hotel
Jan was born, and Jan&rsquo;s mother died.&nbsp; She was a foreigner,
it was supposed, and her husband also, for they talked a foreign language
to each other.&nbsp; He was not with her when she first came, but he
joined her afterwards, and was with her at her death.&nbsp; So far the
Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife spoke upon hearsay.&nbsp; Though employed at
the hotel, which was very full, she was not sleeping in the house; she
was not on good terms with the landlady, nor even with the other servants,
and her first real connection with the matter was when the gentleman,
overhearing some &ldquo;words&rdquo; between her and the landlady at
the bar, abruptly asked her if she were in want of employment.&nbsp;
He employed her, - to take the child to the very town where she was
now living as the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; He did not come with
her, as he had to attend his wife&rsquo;s funeral.&nbsp; It was understood
at the hotel that he was going to take the body abroad for interment.&nbsp;
So the porter had said.&nbsp; The person to whom she was directed to
bring the child was a respectable old woman, living in the outskirts
of the town, whose business was sick-nursing.&nbsp; She seemed, however,
to be comfortably off, and had not been out for some time.&nbsp; She
had been nurse to the gentleman in his childhood, so she once told the
Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife with tears.&nbsp; But she was always shedding
tears, either over the baby, or as she sat over her big Bible, &ldquo;for
ever having to wipe her spectacles, and tears running over her nose
ridic&rsquo;lus to behold.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was pious, and read the
Bible aloud in the evening.&nbsp; Then she had fainting fits; she could
not go uphill or upstairs without great difficulty, and she had one
of her fits when she first saw the child.&nbsp; If with these infirmities
of body and mind the ex-nurse had been easily managed, the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
wife professed that she could have borne it with patience.&nbsp; But
the old woman was painfully shrewd, and there was no hoodwinking her.&nbsp;
She never allowed the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife to go out without her,
and contrived, in spite of a hundred plans and excuses, to prevent her
from speaking to any of the townspeople alone.&nbsp; Never, said Sal,
never could she have put up with it, even for the short time before
the gentleman came down to them, but for knowing it would be a paying
job.&nbsp; But his arrival was the signal for another catastrophe, which
ended in Jan&rsquo;s becoming a child of the mill.<br>
<br>
If the sight of the baby had nearly overpowered the old nurse, the sight
of the dark-eyed gentleman overwhelmed her yet more.&nbsp; Then they
were closeted together for a long time, and the old woman&rsquo;s tongue
hardly ever stopped.&nbsp; Sal explained that she would not have been
such a fool as to let this conversation escape her, if she could have
helped it.&nbsp; She took her place at the keyhole, and had an excuse
ready for the old woman, if she should come out suddenly.&nbsp; The
old woman came out suddenly; but she did not wait for the excuse.&nbsp;
She sent the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife civilly on an errand into the kitchen,
and then followed her, and shut the door and turned the key upon her
without hesitation, leaving her unable to hear any thing but the tones
of the conversation through the parlor wall.&nbsp; She never opened
the door again.&nbsp; As far as the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife could tell,
the old woman seemed to be remonstrating and pleading; the gentleman
spoke now and then.&nbsp; Then there was a lull, then a thud, then a
short pause, and then the parlor-door was burst open, and the gentleman
came flying towards the kitchen, and calling for the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; The fact that the door was locked caused some delay, and
delay was not desirable.&nbsp; The old nurse had had &ldquo;a fit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When the doctor came, he gave no hope of her life.&nbsp; She had had
heart disease for many years, he said.&nbsp; In the midst of this confusion,
a letter came for the gentleman, which seemed absolutely to distract
him.&nbsp; He bade Sal get the little Jan ready, and put his clothes
together, and they started that evening for the mill.&nbsp; Sal believed
it was the doctor who recommended Mrs. Lake as a foster-mother for the
baby, having attended her child.&nbsp; The storm came on after they
started.&nbsp; The child had been very sickly ever since they left London.&nbsp;
The gentleman took the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife straight back to the
station, paid her handsomely, and sent her up to town again.&nbsp; She
had never seen him since.&nbsp; As to his name, it so happened she had
never heard it at the hotel; but when he was setting her off to the
country with the child, she asked it, and he told her that it was Ford.&nbsp;
The old nurse also spoke of him as Mr. Ford, but - so Sal fancied -
with a sort of effort, which made her suspect that it was not his real
name.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, it be!&rdquo; said George, who had followed the narrative
with open-mouthed interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;It be aal right.&nbsp; I knows.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas a gentleman by the name of Ford as cried his pocket-book,
and the vive-pound bill in the papers.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis aal right.&nbsp;
Ford - Jan Ford be the little varment&rsquo;s name then, and he be gentry-born,
too!&nbsp; Missus Lake she allus said so, she did, sartinly.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
George was so absorbed by the flood of information which had burst upon
him all at once, and by adjusting his clumsy thoughts to the new view
of Jan, that he did not stop to think whether the Cheap Jack and his
wife had known of the lost pocket-book and the reward.&nbsp; They had
not.&nbsp; The dark gentleman had no wish to reopen communication with
the woman he had employed.&nbsp; He thought (and rightly) that the book
had fallen when he stumbled over his cloak in getting into the carriage,
and he had refused to advertise it except in the local papers.&nbsp;
And at that time the Cheap Jack and Sal were both in London.<br>
<br>
But George&rsquo;s incautious speech recalled one or two facts to them,
and whilst George sat slowly endeavoring to realize that new idea, &ldquo;Master
Jan Ford, full young gentleman, and at least half Frenchman&rdquo; (for
of any other foreigners George knew nothing), the Cheap Jack was pondering
the words &ldquo;five-pound bill,&rdquo; and connecting them with George&rsquo;s
account of his savings when they last met; and his quicker spouse was
also putting two and two together, but with a larger sum.&nbsp; At the
same instant the Cheap Jack inquired after George&rsquo;s money, and
his wife asked about the letter.&nbsp; But George had hastily come to
a decision.&nbsp; If the tale told by the woman were true, he had got
a great deal of information for nothing, and he saw no reason for sharing
whatever the letter might contain with those most likely to profit by
it.&nbsp; As to letting the Cheap Jack have any thing whatever to do
with the disposal of his savings, nothing could be further from his
intentions.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Gearge bean&rsquo;t such a vool as a looks,&rdquo; thought that
worthy, and aloud he vowed, with unnecessary oaths, that the money was
still in the bank, and that he had forgotten to bring the letter, which
was in a bundle that he had left at the mill.<br>
<br>
This disappointment did not, however, diminish the civility of the Cheap
Jack&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; She was very hospitable, and even pressed George
to spend the night at their house, which he declined.&nbsp; He had a
dread of the Cheap Jack, which was almost superstitious.<br>
<br>
For her civility, indeed, the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife was taken to task
by her husband in a few moments when they were alone together.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I thought you was sharper than to be took in by him!&rdquo; said
the hunchback, indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you believe all that gag
about the bank and the bundle? and you, as soft to him, telling him
every blessed thing, and he stowed the cash and the letter somewheres
where we shall never catch a sight of &rsquo;em, and got every thing
out of you as easy as shelling a pod of peas.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in language
as strong as that of the miller&rsquo;s man the Cheap Jack swore he
could have done better himself a hundred times over.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Could you?&rdquo; said the large-mouthed woman, contemptuously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t live long in the country, I wouldn&rsquo;t,
if it was to make me such a owl as you&rsquo;ve turned into.&nbsp; It
ain&rsquo;t much farther than your nose <i>you</i> sees!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Never mind me, Sal, my dear,&rdquo; said the hunchback, anxiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I trusts you, my dear.&nbsp; And it seems to me as if you thought
he&rsquo;d got &rsquo;em about him.&nbsp; Do you, my dear, and why?&nbsp;
And why did you tell him the truth, straight on end, when a made-up
tale would have done as well, and kept him in the dark?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why did I tell him the truth?&rdquo; repeated the woman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos I ain&rsquo;t such a countrified fool as to think
lies is allus the cleverest tip, &rsquo;cos the truth went farthest
this time.&nbsp; Why do I think he&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em about him?&nbsp;
First, &rsquo;cos he swore so steady he hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; For a ready
lie, and for acting a lie, and over-acting it at times, give me townspeople;
but for a thundering big un, against all reason, and for sticking to
it stupid when they&rsquo;re downright convicted, and with a face as
innercent as a baby&rsquo;s, give me a country lump.&nbsp; And next,
because I can tell with folks a deal sharper than him, even to which
side of &rsquo;em the pocket is they&rsquo;ve got what they wants to
hide in, by the way they moves their head and their hands.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Which side is it of him, Sal?&rdquo; said the hunchback, with
ugly eagerness.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The left,&rdquo; said Sal; &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t be there
long.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XVII.<br>
<br>
THE MILLER&rsquo;S MAN AT THE MOP. - A LIVELY COMPANION. - SAL LOSES
HER PURSE. - THE RECRUITING SERGEANT. - THE POCKET-BOOK TWICE STOLEN.
- GEORGE IN THE KING&rsquo;S ARMS. - GEORGE IN THE KING&rsquo;S SERVICE.
- THE LETTER CHANGES HANDS, BUT KEEPS ITS SECRET.<br>
<br>
For some years the ex-servant of the windmill had been rather favored
by fortune than otherwise.&nbsp; He found the pocket-book, and, though
he could not read the letter, he got the five-pound note.&nbsp; Since
then, his gains, honest and dishonest, had been much beyond his needs,
and his savings were not small.&nbsp; Suspicion was just beginning to
connect his name and that of the Cheap Jack with certain thefts committed
in the neighborhood, when he made up his mind to go.<br>
<br>
His wealth was not generally known.&nbsp; Many a time had he been tempted
to buy pigs (a common speculation in the district, and the first stone
of more than one rustic fortune), but the dread of exciting suspicion
balanced the almost certain profit, and he could never make up his mind.&nbsp;
For Master Lake paid only five pounds a year for his man&rsquo;s valuable
services, which, even in a district where at that time habits were simple,
and boots not made of brown paper, did not leave much margin for the
purchase of pigs.&nbsp; The pig speculation, though profitable, was
not safe.&nbsp; George had made money, however, and he had escaped detection.&nbsp;
On the whole, he had been fortunate.&nbsp; But that mop saw a turn in
the tide of his affairs, and ended strangely with him.<br>
<br>
It began otherwise.&nbsp; George had never felt more convinced of his
power to help himself at the expense of his neighbors than he did after
getting Sal&rsquo;s information, and keeping back his own, before they
started to join in the amusements of the fair.&nbsp; He was on good
terms with himself; none the less so that he had not failed to see the
Cheap Jack&rsquo;s chagrin, as the woman poured forth all she knew for
George&rsquo;s benefit, and got nothing in return.<br>
<br>
The vanity of the ignorant knows no check except from without; under
flattery, it is boundless, and the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife found no
difficulty in fooling George to the top of his bent.<br>
<br>
George was rather proud, too, of his companion.&nbsp; She was not, as
has been said, ill-looking but for her mouth, and beauty was not abundant
enough in the neighborhood to place her at much disadvantage.&nbsp;
Fashionable finery was even less common, and the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
wife was showily dressed.&nbsp; And George found her a very pleasant
companion; much livelier than the slow-witted damsels of the country-side.&nbsp;
For him she had nothing but flattery; but her smart speeches at the
expense of other people in the crowd caused the miller&rsquo;s man to
double up his long back with laughter.<br>
<br>
A large proportion of the country wives and sweethearts tramped up and
down the fair at the heels of their husbands and swains, like squaws
after their Indian spouses.&nbsp; But the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife asked
George for his arm, - the left one, - and she clung to it all the day.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Quite the lady in her manners she be,&rdquo; thought George.&nbsp;
She called him &ldquo;Mr. Sannel,&rdquo; too.&nbsp; George felt that
she admired him.&nbsp; For a moment his satisfaction was checked, when
she called his attention to the good looks of a handsome recruiting
sergeant, who was strutting about the mop with an air expressing not
so much that it all belonged to him as that he didn&rsquo;t at all belong
to it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But there, he ain&rsquo;t to hold a candle to you, Mr. Sannel,
though his coat do sit well upon him,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
wife.<br>
<br>
It gratified George&rsquo;s standing ill-will to the Cheap Jack to have
&ldquo;cut him out&rdquo; with this showy lady, and to laugh loudly
with her upon his arm, whilst the hunchback followed, like a discontented
cur, at their heels.&nbsp; If there was a drawback to the merits of
his lively companion, it was her power of charming the money out of
George&rsquo;s pocket.<br>
<br>
The money that he disbursed came from the right-hand pocket of his red
waistcoat.&nbsp; In the left-hand pocket (and the pockets, like the
pattern of the waistcoat, were large) was the lost pocket-book.&nbsp;
It was a small one, and just fitted in nicely.&nbsp; In the pocket-book
were George&rsquo;s savings, chiefly in paper.&nbsp; Notes were more
portable than coin, and, as George meant to invest them somewhere where
he was not known, no suspicions need be raised by their value.&nbsp;
The letter was there also.<br>
<br>
There were plenty of shows at the mop, and the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife
saw them all.&nbsp; The travelling wax-works; the menagerie with a very
mangy lion in an appallingly rickety cage; the fat Scotchman, a monster
made more horrible to view by a dress of royal Stuart tartan; the penny
theatre, and a mermaid in a pickling-tub.<br>
<br>
One treat only she declined.&nbsp; The miller&rsquo;s man would have
paid for a shilling portrait of her, but she refused to be taken.<br>
<br>
The afternoon was wearing away, when Sal caught sight of some country
bumpkins upon a stage, who were preparing to grin through horse-collars
against each other for the prize of a hat.&nbsp; As she had never seen
or heard of the entertainment, George explained it to her.<br>
<br>
It was a contest in which the ugliest won the prize.&nbsp; Only the
widest-mouthed, most grotesque-looking clowns of the place attempted
to compete; and he won who, besides being the ugliest by nature, could
&ldquo;grin&rdquo; and contort his features in the mode which most tickled
the fancy of the beholders.&nbsp; George had once competed himself,
and had only failed to secure the hat because his nearest rival could
squint as well as grin; and he was on the point of boasting of this,
but on second thoughts he kept the fact to himself.<br>
<br>
Very willing indeed he was to escort his companion to a show in the
open air for which nothing was charged, and they plunged valiantly into
the crowd.&nbsp; The crowd was huge, but George&rsquo;s height and strength
stood him in good stead, and he pushed on, and dragged Sal with him.&nbsp;
There was some confusion on the stage.&nbsp; A nigger, with a countenance
which of itself moved the populace to roars of laughter, had applied
to be allowed to compete.&nbsp; Opinions were divided as to whether
it would be fair to native talent, whilst there was a strong desire
to see a face that in its natural condition was &ldquo;as good as a
play,&rdquo; with the additional attractions of a horse-collar and a
grin.<br>
<br>
The country clowns on the stage fumed, and the nigger grinned and bowed,
and the crowd yelled, and surged, and swayed, and weak people got trampled,
and everybody was tightly squeezed, and the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife
was alarmed, and withdrew her hand from George&rsquo;s arm, and begged
him to hold her up, which he gallantly did, she meanwhile clinging with
both hands to his smock.<br>
<br>
As to the hunchback, it is hardly necessary to say that he did not get
very far into the crowd, and when his wife and George returned, laughing
gayly, they found him standing outside, with a sulky face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look
here, missus,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a enjoying of yourself,
but I&rsquo;m not.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got the blunt, so just hand over
a few coppers, and I&rsquo;ll get a pint at the King&rsquo;s Arms.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Sal began fumbling to find her pocket, but when she found it, she gave
a shriek, and turned it inside out.&nbsp; It was empty!<br>
<br>
If the miller&rsquo;s man had enjoyed himself before, he was not to
be envied now.&nbsp; The Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife poured forth her woes
in a continuous stream of complaint.&nbsp; She minutely described the
purse which she had lost, the age and quality of her dress, and the
impossibility of there being a hole in her pocket.&nbsp; She took George&rsquo;s
arm once more, and insisted upon revisiting every stall and show where
they had been, to see if her purse had been found.&nbsp; Up and down
George toiled with her, wiping his face and feeling that he looked like
a fool, as at each place in turn they were told that they might as well
&ldquo;look for a needle in a bottle of hay,&rdquo; and that pickpockets
were as plenty at a mop as blackberries in September.<br>
<br>
He was tired of the woman now she was troublesome, and fidgetingly persevering,
as women are apt to be, and he was vexed to feel how little money was
left in his right-hand pocket.&nbsp; He did not think of feeling in
the left one, not merely because the Cheap Jack was standing in front
of him, but because no fear for the safety of its contents had dawned
upon him.&nbsp; It was easy for a woman to lose her purse out of a pocket
flapping loosely in the drapery of her skirts, but that any thing stowed
tightly away in a man&rsquo;s waistcoat under his smock could be stolen
in broad daylight without his knowledge did not occur to him.&nbsp;
As little did he guess that of all the pickpockets who were supposed
to drive a brisk trade at the fair, the quickest, the cleverest, the
most practised professional was the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife.<br>
<br>
She had feigned to see &ldquo;something&rdquo; on the ground near an
oyster stall, which she said &ldquo;might be&rdquo; her purse.&nbsp;
As indeed it might as well as any thing else, seeing that the said purse
had no existence.<br>
<br>
As she left them, George turned to the Cheap Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look
&rsquo;ee here, Jack,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;take thee missus whoam.&nbsp;
She do seem to be so put about, &rsquo;tis no manner of use her stopping
in the mop.&nbsp; And I be off for a pint of something to wash my throat
out.&nbsp; I be mortal dry with running up and down after she.&nbsp;
Women does make such a caddle about things.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You might stand a pint for an old friend, George, my dear,&rdquo;
said the Cheap Jack, following him.&nbsp; But George hurried on, and
shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;tak&rsquo;
thee missus whoam, I tell &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ve not seen much
at your expense today, if she have lost her pus.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
With which the miller&rsquo;s man escaped into the King&rsquo;s Arms,
and pushed his way to the farthest end of the room, where a large party
of men were drinking and smoking.<br>
<br>
At a table near him sat the recruiting sergeant whom he had noticed
before, and he now examined him more closely.<br>
<br>
He was of a not uncommon type of non-commissioned officers in the English
service.&nbsp; Not of a very intellectual - hardly perhaps of an interesting
- kind of good looks, he was yet a strikingly handsome man.&nbsp; His
features were good and clearly cut; his hair and moustache were dark,
thick, short and glossy; his dark eyes were quick and bright; his figure
was well-made, and better developed; his shapely hands were not only
clean, they were fastidiously trimmed about the nails (a daintiness
common below the rank of sergeant, especially among men acting as clerks);
and if the stone in his signet ring was not a real onyx, it looked quite
as well at a distance, and the absence of a crest was not conspicuous.&nbsp;
He spoke with a very good imitation of the accent of the officers he
had served with, and in his alertness, his well-trained movements, his
upright carriage, and his personal cleanliness, he came so near to looking
like a gentleman that he escaped it only by a certain swagger, which
proved an ill-chosen substitute for well-bred ease.<br>
<br>
To George&rsquo;s eyes this was not visible as a fault.&nbsp; The sergeant
was as much &ldquo;the swell&rdquo; as George could imagine any man
to be.<br>
<br>
George Sannel could never remember with distinctness the ensuing events
of that afternoon.&nbsp; Dim memories remained with him of the sergeant
meeting his long stare with some civilities, to which he was conscious
of having replied less suitably than he might have wished.&nbsp; At
one period, certainly, bets were made upon the height of himself and
the handsome soldier, respectively, and he was sure that they were put
back to back, and that he proved the taller man; and that it was somehow
impressed upon him that he did not look so, because the other carried
himself so much better.&nbsp; It was also impressed upon him, somehow,
that if he would consent to be well-dressed, well-fed, and well-lodged,
at the expense of the country, his own appearance would quickly rival
that of the sergeant, and that the reigning Sovereign would gladly pay,
as well as keep and clothe, such an ornamental bulwark of the state.&nbsp;
At some other period the sergeant had undoubtedly told him to &ldquo;give
it a name,&rdquo; and the name he gave it was sixpenny ale, which he
drank at the sergeant&rsquo;s expense, and which was followed by shandy-gaff,
on the same footing.<br>
<br>
At what time and for what reason George put his hand into his left-hand
waistcoat pocket he never could remember.&nbsp; But when he did so,
and found it empty, the cry he raised had such a ring of anguish as
might have awakened pity for him, even where his ill deeds were fully
known.<br>
<br>
The position was perplexing, if he had had a sober head to consider
it with.&nbsp; That pickpockets abounded had been well impressed upon
his slow intellect, and that there was no means of tracing property
so lost, in the crowd and confusion of the mop.&nbsp; True, his property
was worth &ldquo;crying,&rdquo; worth offering a reward for.&nbsp; But
the pocket-book was not his, and the letter was not addressed to him;
and it was doubtful if he even dare run the risk of claiming them.<br>
<br>
His first despair was succeeded by a sort of drunken fury, in which
he accused the men sitting with him of robbing him, and then swore it
was the Cheap Jack, and so raved till the landlord of the King&rsquo;s
Arms expelled him as &ldquo;drunk and disorderly,&rdquo; and most of
the company refused to believe that he had had any such sum of money
to lose.<br>
<br>
Exactly how or where, after this, the sergeant found him, George could
not remember, but his general impression of the sergeant&rsquo;s kindness
was strong.&nbsp; He could recall that he pumped upon his head in the
yard of the King&rsquo;s Arms, to sober him, by George&rsquo;s own request;
and that it did somewhat clear his brain, his remembrance of seeing
the sergeant wipe his fingers on a cambric handkerchief seems to prove.&nbsp;
They then paced up and down together arm in arm, if not as accurately
in step as might have been agreeable to the soldier.&nbsp; George remembered
hearing of prize money, to which his own loss was a bagatelle, and gathering
on the whole that the army, as a profession, opened a sort of boundless
career of opportunities to a man of his peculiar talents and appearance.&nbsp;
There was something infectious, too, in the gay easy style in which
the soldier seemed to treat fortune, good or ill; and the miller&rsquo;s
man was stimulated at last to vow that he was not such a fool as he
looked, and would &ldquo;never say die.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the best of
his belief, the sergeant replied in terms which showed that, had he
been &ldquo;in cash,&rdquo; George&rsquo;s loss would have been made
good by him, out of pure generosity, and on the spot.<br>
<br>
As it was, he pressed upon his acceptance the sum of one shilling, which
the miller&rsquo;s man pocketed with tears.<br>
<br>
What recruit can afterwards remember which argument of the skilful sergeant
did most to melt his discretion into valor?<br>
<br>
The sun had not dried the dew from the wolds, and the sails of the windmill
hung idle in the morning air, when George Sannel made his first march
to the drums and fifes, with ribbons flying from his hat, a recruit
of the 206th (Royal Wiltshire) Regiment of Foot.<br>
<br>
<br>
As the Cheap Jack and his wife hastened home from the mop, Sal had some
difficulty in restraining her husband&rsquo;s impatience to examine
the pocket-book as they walked along.<br>
<br>
Prudence prevailed, however, and it was not opened till they were at
home and alone.<br>
<br>
In notes and money, George&rsquo;s savings amounted to more than thirteen
pounds.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Pretty well, my dear,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack, grinning hideously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now for the letter.&nbsp; Read it aloud, Sal, my dear; you&rsquo;re
a better scholar than me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Sal opened the thin, well-worn sheet, and read the word &ldquo;Moerdyk,&rdquo;
but then she paused.&nbsp; And, like Abel, she paused so long that the
hunchback pressed impatiently to look over her shoulder.<br>
<br>
But the letter was written in a foreign language, and the Cheap Jack
and his wife were no wiser for it than the miller&rsquo;s man.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
<br>
MIDSUMMER HOLIDAYS. - CHILD FANCIES. - JAN AND THE PIG-MINDER. - MASTER
SALTER AT HOME. - JAN HIRES HIMSELF OUT.<br>
<br>
Midsummer came, and the Dame&rsquo;s school broke up for the holidays.&nbsp;
Jan had longed for them intensely.&nbsp; Not that he was oppressed by
the labors of learning, but that he wanted to be out of doors.&nbsp;
Many a little one was equally eager for the freedom of the fields, but
the common child-love for hedges and ditches, and flower-picking, and
the like, was intensified in Jan by a deeper pleasure which country
scenes awoke from the artist nature within him.&nbsp; That it is no
empty sentimentality to speak of an artist nature in a child, let the
child-memories of all artists bear witness!&nbsp; That they inspired
the poet Wordsworth with one of his best poems, and that they have dyed
the canvas of most landscape painters with the indestructible local
coloring of the scenes of each man&rsquo;s childhood, will hardly be
denied.<br>
<br>
That this is against the wishes and the theories of many excellent people
has nothing to do with its truth.&nbsp; If all children were the bluff,
hearty, charmingly naughty, enviably happy, utterly simple and unsentimental
beings that some of us wish, and so assert them to be, it might be better
for them, or it might not - who can say?&nbsp; That the healthy, careless,
rough and ready type is the one to encourage, many will agree, who cannot
agree that it is universal, or even much the most common.&nbsp; It is
probably from an imperfect remembrance of their nursery lives that some
people believe that the griefs of one&rsquo;s childhood are light, its
joys uncomplicated, and its tastes simple.&nbsp; A clearer recollection
of the favorite poetry and the most cherished day-dreams of very early
years would probably convince them that the strongest taste for tragedy
comes before one&rsquo;s teens, and inclines to the melodramatic; that
sentimentality (of some kind) is grateful to the verge of mawkishness;
and that simple tastes are rather a result of culture and experience
than natural gifts of infancy.<br>
<br>
But in this rummaging up of the crude tastes, the hot little opinions,
the romance, the countless visions, the many affectations of nursery
days, there will be recalled also a very real love of nature; varying,
of course, in its intensity from a mere love of fresh air and free romping,
and a destructive taste for nosegays, to a living romance about the
daily walks of the imaginative child, - a world apart, peopled with
invisible company, such as fairies, and those fancy friends which some
children devise for themselves, or with the beasts and flowers, to which
love has given a personality.<br>
<br>
To the romance child-fancy weaves for itself about the meadows where
the milkmaids stand thick and pale, and those green courts where lords
and ladies live, Jan added that world of pleasure open to those gifted
with a keen sense of form and color.&nbsp; Strange gleams under a stormy
sky, sunshine on some kingfisher&rsquo;s plumage rising from the river,
and all the ever-changing beauties about him, stirred his heart with
emotions that he could not have defined.<br>
<br>
There was much to see even from Dame Datchett&rsquo;s open door, but
there was more to be imagined.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s envy of the pig-minder
had reached a great height when the last school-day came.<br>
<br>
He wanted to be free by the time that the pig-herd brought his pigs
to water, and his wishes were fulfilled.&nbsp; The Dame&rsquo;s flock
and the flock of the swineherd burst at one and the same moment into
the water-meadows, and Jan was soon in conversation with the latter.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thee likes pig-minding, I reckon?&rdquo; said Jan, stripping
the leaves from a sallywithy wand, which he had picked to imitate that
of the swineherd.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; said the large-coated urchin, wiping his face with
the big sleeve of his blue coat.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s aal thee
knows about un.&nbsp; I be going to leave to-morrow, I be.&nbsp; And
if so be Master Salter&rsquo;s got another bwoy, or if so be he&rsquo;s
not, I dunno, it ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to I.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan learned that he had eighteen pence a week for driving the pigs to
a wood at some little distance, where they fed on acorns, beech-mast,
etc.; for giving them water, keeping them together, and bringing them
home at teatime.&nbsp; He allowed that he could drive them as slowly
as he pleased, and that they kept pretty well together in the wood;
but that, as a whole, the perversity of pigs was such that -&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
wait till ee tries it theeself, Jan Lake, that&rsquo;s aal.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan had resolved to do so.&nbsp; He did not return with his foster-brothers
to the mill.&nbsp; He slipped off on one of his solitary expeditions,
and made his way to the farm-house of Master Salter.<br>
<br>
Master Salter and his wife sat at tea in the kitchen.&nbsp; In the cheerful
clatter of cups, they had failed to hear Jan&rsquo;s knock; but the
sunshine streaming through the open doorway being broken by some small
body, the farmer&rsquo;s wife looked hastily up, thinking that the new-born
calf had got loose, and was on the threshold.<br>
<br>
But it was Jan.&nbsp; The outer curls of his hair gleamed in the sunlight
like an aureole about his face.&nbsp; He had doffed his hat, out of
civility, and he held it in one hand, whilst with the other he fingered
the slate that hung at his waist.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Massey upon us!&rdquo; said the farmer, looking up at the same
instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who be thee?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jan Lake, the miller&rsquo;s son, maester.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Come in, come in!&rdquo; cried Master Salter, hospitably.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So Master Lake have sent thee with a message, eh?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My father didn&rsquo;t send me,&rdquo; said Jan, gravely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I come myself.&nbsp; Do &rsquo;ee want a pig-minder, Master Salter?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, I wants a pig-minder.&nbsp; But I reckon thee father can&rsquo;t
spare Abel for that now.&nbsp; A wish he could.&nbsp; Abel was careful
with the pigs, he was, and a sprack boy, too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful, main careful, Master Salter,&rdquo; said
Jan, earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I likes pigs.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the farmer
was pondering.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jan Lake - Jan,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be thee the boy
as draad out the sow and her pigs for Master Chuter&rsquo;s little gel?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Jan nodded.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Lor massey!&rdquo; cried Master Salter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;
told&rsquo;ee, missus, about un.&nbsp; Look here, Jan Lake.&nbsp; If
thee&rsquo;ll draa me out some pigs like them, I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;ee
sixpence and a new slate, and I&rsquo;ll try thee for a week, anyhow.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan drew the slate-pencil from his pocket without reply.&nbsp; Mrs.
Salter, who had been watching him with motherly eyes, pushed a small
stool towards him, and he began to draw a scene such as he had been
studying daily for months past, - pigs at the water-side.&nbsp; He had
made dozens of such sketches.&nbsp; But the delight of the farmer knew
no bounds.&nbsp; He slapped his knees, he laughed till the tears ran
down his cheeks, and, as Jan put a very wicked eye into the face of
the hindmost pig, he laughed merrily also.&nbsp; He was not insensible
of his own talents, and the stimulus of the farmer&rsquo;s approbation
gave vigor to his strokes.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here, missus,&rdquo; cried Master Salter; &ldquo;get down our
Etherd&rsquo;s new slate, and give it to un; I&rsquo;ll get another
for he.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s the sixpence, Jan; and if thee minds
pigs as well as &rsquo;ee draas &rsquo;em, I don&rsquo;t care how long
&rsquo;ee minds mine.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The object of his visit being now accomplished, Jan took up his hat
to depart, but an important omission struck him, and he turned to say,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ee give me for minding your pigs, Master
Salter?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Master Salter was economical, and Jan was small, and anxious for the
place.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A shilling a week,&rdquo; said the farmer.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And his tea?&rdquo; the missus gently suggested.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Master Salter.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
shilling a week and thee tea.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan paused.&nbsp; His predecessor had had eighteen pence for very imperfect
services.&nbsp; Jan meant to be beyond reproach, and felt himself worth
quite as much.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I give the other boy one and sixpence,&rdquo; said the farmer,
&ldquo;but thee&rsquo;s very small.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sprack,&rdquo; said Jan, confidently.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
I be fond of pigs.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Massey upon me,&rdquo; said Master Salter, laughing again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tis a peart young toad, sartinly.&nbsp; A might be fifty year
old, for the ways of un.&nbsp; Well, thee shall have a shilling and
thee tea, or one and sixpence without, then.&rdquo;&nbsp; And seeing
that Jan glanced involuntarily at the table, the farmer added, &ldquo;Give
un some now, missus.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll lay a pound bill the child be
hungry.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan was hungry.&nbsp; He had bartered the food from his &ldquo;nunchin
bag&rdquo; at dinner-time for another child&rsquo;s new slate-pencil.&nbsp;
The cakes were very good, too, and Mrs. Salter was liberal.&nbsp; He
rose greatly in her esteem by saying grace before meat.&nbsp; He cooled
his tea in his saucer too, and raised it to his lips with his little
finger stuck stiffly out (a mark of gentility imparted by Mrs. Lake),
and in all points conducted himself with the utmost propriety.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For what we have received the Lord be praised,&rdquo; was his
form of giving thanks; to which Mrs. Salter added, &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Bless his heart!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Jan, picking up his hat,
lifted his dark eyes candidly to the farmer&rsquo;s face, and said with
much gravity and decision, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a shilling a week and me tea, Master Salter,
if it be all the same to you.&nbsp; And thank you kindly, sir, and the
missus likewise.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XIX.<br>
<br>
THE BLUE COAT. - PIG-MINDING AND TREE-STUDYING. - LEAF-PAINTINGS. -
A STRANGER. - MASTER SWIFT IS DISAPPOINTED.<br>
<br>
When Jan returned to the windmill, and gravely announced that he had
hired himself out as pig-minder to Master Salter, Mrs. Lake was, as
she said, &ldquo;put about.&rdquo;&nbsp; She considered pig-minding
quite beneath the dignity of her darling, and brought forward every
objection she could think of except the real one.&nbsp; But the windmiller
had no romantic dreams on Jan&rsquo;s behalf, and he decided that &ldquo;&rsquo;twas
better he should be arning a shillin&rsquo; a week than gettin&rsquo;
into mischief at whoam.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s ambition, however,
was not satisfied.&nbsp; He wanted a blue coat, such as is worn by the
shepherd-boys on the plains.&nbsp; He did not mind how old it was, but
it must be large; long in the skirt and sleeves.&nbsp; He had woven
such a romance about Master Salter&rsquo;s swineherd and his life, as
he watched him week after week from Dame Datchett&rsquo;s door with
envious eyes, that even his coat, with the tails almost sweeping the
ground, seemed to Jan to have a dignified air.&nbsp; And there really
was something to be said in favor of sleeves so long that he could turn
them back into a huge cuff in summer, and turn them down, Chinese fashion,
over his hands in winter, to keep them warm.<br>
<br>
Such a blue coat Abel had possessed, but it was not suitable for mill
work, and Mrs. Lake was easily persuaded to give it to Jan.&nbsp; He
refused to have it curtailed, or in any way adapted to his figure, and
in it, with a switch of his own cutting, he presented himself at Master
Salter&rsquo;s farm in good time the following morning.<br>
<br>
It could not be said that Jan&rsquo;s predecessor had exaggerated the
perversity of the pigs he drove.&nbsp; If the coat of his choice had
a fault in Jan&rsquo;s estimation, it was that it helped to make him
very hot as he ran hither and thither after his flock.&nbsp; But he
had not studied pig-nature in vain.&nbsp; He had a good deal of sympathy
with its vagaries, and he was quite able to outwit the pigs.&nbsp; Indeed,
a curious attachment grew up between the little swineherd and his flock,
some of whom would come at his call, when he rewarded their affection,
as he had gained it, by scratching their backs with a rough stick.<br>
<br>
But there were times when their playful and errant peculiarities were
no small annoyance to him.&nbsp; Jan was growing fast both in mind and
body.&nbsp; Phases of taste and occupation succeed each other very rapidly
when one is young; and there are, perhaps, no more distinct phases,
more sudden strides, than in the art of painting.&nbsp; With Jan the
pig phase was going, and it was followed by landscape-sketching.<br>
<br>
Jan was drawing his pigs one day in the little wood, when he fancied
that the gnarled elbow of a branch near him had, in its outline, some
likeness to a pig&rsquo;s face, and he began to sketch it on his slate.&nbsp;
But in studying the tree the grotesque likeness was forgotten, and there
burst upon his mind, as a revelation, the sense of that world of beauty
which lies among stems and branches, twigs and leaves.&nbsp; Painfully,
but with happy pains, he traced the branch joint by joint, curve by
curve, as it spread from the parent stem and tapered to its last delicate
twigs.&nbsp; It was like following a river from its source to the sea.&nbsp;
But to that sea of summer sky, in which the final ramifications of his
branch were lost, Jan did not reach.&nbsp; He was abruptly stopped by
the edge of his slate, which would hold no more.<br>
<br>
To remedy this, when next he drew trees, he began the branches from
the outer tips, and worked inwards to the stem.&nbsp; It was done for
convenience, but to this habit he used afterwards to lay some of the
merit of his admirable touch in tree-painting.&nbsp; And so &ldquo;pig-making&rdquo;
became an amusement of the past, and the spell of the woods fell on
Jan.<br>
<br>
It was no very wonderful wood either, this one where he first herded
pigs and studied trees.&nbsp; It was composed chiefly of oaks and beeches,
none of them of very grand proportions.&nbsp; But it was little cut
and little trodden.&nbsp; The bramble-bowers were unbroken, the leaf-mould
was deep and rich, and a very tiny stream, which trickled out of sight,
kept mosses ever green about its bed.&nbsp; The whole wood was fragrant
with honeysuckle, which pushed its way everywhere, and gay with other
wild flowers.&nbsp; But the trees were Jan&rsquo;s delight.&nbsp; He
would lie on his back and gaze up into them with unwearying pleasure.&nbsp;
He looked at his old etching with new interest, to see how the artist
had done the branches of the willows by the water-mill.&nbsp; And then
he would get Abel to put a very sharp point to his own slate-pencil,
and would go back to the real oaks and beeches, which were so difficult
and yet so fascinating to him.<br>
<br>
He was very happy in the wood, with two drawbacks.&nbsp; The pigs would
stray when he became absorbed in his sketching, and the slate and slate-pencil,
which did very well to draw pigs in outline, were miserable implements,
when more than half the beauty of the subject to be represented was
in its color.&nbsp; For the first evil there was no remedy but to give
chase.&nbsp; Out of the second came an amusement in favor of which even
the beloved slate hung idle.<br>
<br>
In watching beautiful bits of coloring in the wood, contrasted greens
of many hues, some jutting branch with yellowish foliage caught by the
sun, and relieved by a distance of blue grays beyond, - colors and contrasts
which only grew lovelier as the heavy green of midsummer was broken
by the inroad of autumnal tints, - Jan noticed also that among the fallen
leaves at his feet there were some of nearly every color in the foliage
above.&nbsp; At first it was by a sort of idle trick that he matched
one against the other, as a lady sorts silks for her embroidery; then
he arranged bits of the leaves upon the outline on his slate, and then,
the slate being too small, he amused himself by grouping the leaves
upon the path in front of him into woodland scenes.&nbsp; The idea had
been partly suggested to him by a bottle which stood on Mrs. Salter&rsquo;s
mantelpiece, containing colored sands arranged into landscapes; a work
of art sent by Mrs. Salter&rsquo;s sister from the Isle of Wight.<br>
<br>
The slate would have been quite unused, but for the difficulties Jan
got into with his outlines.&nbsp; At last he adopted the plan of making
a sketch upon his slate, which he then laid beside him on the walk,
and copied it in leaves.&nbsp; More perishable even than the pig-drawings,
the evening breeze generally cast these paintings to the winds, but
none the less was Jan happy with them, and sometimes in quiet weather,
or a sheltered nook, they remained undisturbed for days.<br>
<br>
Dame Datchett&rsquo;s school reopened, but Jan would not leave his pigs.&nbsp;
He took the shilling faithfully home each week to his foster-mother.&nbsp;
She found it very useful, and she had no very high ideas about education.&nbsp;
She had some twinges of conscience in the matter, but she had no strength
of purpose, and Jan went his own way.<br>
<br>
The tints had grown very warm on trees and leaves, when Jan one day
accomplished, with much labor, the best painting he had yet done.&nbsp;
It was of a scene before his eyes.&nbsp; The trees were admirably grouped;
he put little bits of twigs for the branches, which now showed more
than hitherto, and he added a glimpse of the sky by neatly dovetailing
the petals of some bluebells into a mosaic.&nbsp; He had turned back
the long sleeves of his coat, and had with difficulty kept the tail
of it from doing damage to his foreground, and had perseveringly kept
the pigs at bay, when, as he returned with a last instalment of bluebells
to finish his sky, he saw a man standing on the path, with his back
to him, completely blotting out the view by his very broad body, and
with one heel not half an inch from Jan&rsquo;s picture.<br>
<br>
He was a coarsely built old man, dressed in threadbare black.&nbsp;
The tones of his voice were broad, and quite unlike the local dialect.&nbsp;
He was speaking as Jan came up, but to no companion that Jan could see,
though his hand was outstretched in sympathy with his words.&nbsp; He
was looking upwards, too, as Jan was wont to look himself, into that
azure sky which he was trying to paint in bluebell flowers.<br>
<br>
In truth, the stranger was spouting poetry, and poems and recitations
were alike unknown to Jan; but something caught his fancy in what he
heard, and the flowers dropped from his fingers as the broad but not
ungraceful accents broke upon his ear: -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The clouds were pure and white
as flocks new shorn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fresh from the clear brook;
sweetly they slept<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the blue fields of heaven, and
then there crept<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little noiseless noise among the
leaves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born of the very sigh that silence
heaves;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For not the faintest motion could
be seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the shades that slanted o&rsquo;er
the green.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The old man paused for an instant, and, turning round, saw Jan, and
put his heavy foot into the sky of Jan&rsquo;s picture.&nbsp; He drew
it back at Jan&rsquo;s involuntary cry, and, after a long look at the
quaint figure before him, said, &ldquo;Are ye one of the fairies, little
man?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But Jan knew nothing of fairies.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be Jan Lake, from the
mill,&rdquo; said he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Are ye so?&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not a miller&rsquo;s coat ye&rsquo;ve
on,&rdquo; said the old man, with a twinkle in his eye.<br>
<br>
Jan looked seriously at it, and then explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be Master
Salter&rsquo;s pig-minder just now, but I&rsquo;ve got a miller&rsquo;s
thumb, I have.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well, Master Pig-minder; and now would ye tell an
old man what ye screamed out for.&nbsp; Did I scare ye?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; said Jan, civilly; and he added, &ldquo;I
liked that you were saying.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Are ye a bit of a poet as well as a pig-minder, then?&rdquo;
and waving his hand with a theatrical gesture up the wood, the old man
began to spout afresh: -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A filbert hedge with wild briar
overtwined,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clumps of woodbine taking the
soft wind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon their summer thrones; there
too should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequent chequer of a youngling
tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That with a score of light green
brethren shoots<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the quaint mossiness of aged
roots:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round which is heard a spring-head
of clear waters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babbling so wildly of its lovely
daughters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spreading bluebells; it may
haply mourn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That such fair clusters should be
rudely torn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their fresh beds, and scattered
thoughtlessly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By infant hands, left on the path
to die.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Between the strange dialect and the unfamiliar terseness of poetry,
Jan did not follow this very clearly, but he caught the allusion to
bluebells, and the old man brought his hand back to his side with a
gesture so expressive towards the bluebell fragments at his feet, that
it hardly needed the tone of reproach he gave to the last few words
- &ldquo;left on the path to die&rdquo; - to make Jan hang his head.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the only blue I could find,&rdquo; he said, looking
ruefully at the fading flowers.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And what for did ye want blue, then, my lad?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To make the sky with,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The powers of the air be good to us!&rdquo; said the stranger,
setting his broad hat back from his face, as if to obtain a clearer
view of the little pig-minder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are ye a sky-maker as well
as a swineherd?&nbsp; And while I&rsquo;m catechising ye, may I ask
for what do ye bring a slate out pig-minding and sky-making?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I draws out the trees on it first,&rdquo; said Jan, &ldquo;and
then I does them in leaves.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll come round,&rdquo;
he added, shyly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll see it.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t tread
on un, please, sir.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The old man fumbled in his pocket, from which he drew a shagreen spectacle-case,
as substantial looking as himself, and, planting the spectacles firmly
on his heavy nose, he held out his hand to Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take me where ye will.&nbsp; To
bonnie Elf-land, if that&rsquo;s your road, where withered leaves are
gold.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan ran round willingly to take the hand of his new friend.&nbsp; He
felt a strange attraction towards him.&nbsp; His speech was puzzling
and had a tone of mockery, but his face was unmistakably kind.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Now then, lad, which path do we go by?&rdquo; said he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one,&rdquo; said Jan, gazing up at the old
man, as if by very staring with his black eyes he could come to understand
him.&nbsp; But in an instant he was spouting again, holding Jan before
him with one hand, whilst he used the other as a sort of <i>b&acirc;ton</i>
to his speech: -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And know&rsquo;st thou not yon
broad, broad road<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lies across the lily levin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the path of sinfulness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though some think it the way to
heaven.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Go on, please!&rdquo; Jan cried, as the old man paused.&nbsp;
His rugged speech seemed plainer in the lines it suited so well, and
a touch of enthusiasm in his voice increased the charm.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And know&rsquo;st thou not that
narrow path<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thick beset with thorns and briars?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the path of righteousness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after it but few aspires.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And know&rsquo;st thou not the
little path<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That winds about the ferny brae?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the road to bonnie Elf-land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where thou and I this night maun
gae.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; said Jan, earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is&rsquo;t
a town?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The old man laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking it would be well
to let that path be, in your company.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d hardly get out
under a year and a day.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go - with you,&rdquo; said Jan, confidently.&nbsp;
Many an expedition had he undertaken on his own responsibility, and
why not this?<br>
<br>
&ldquo;First, show me what ye were going to show me,&rdquo; said the
old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s this sky you&rsquo;ve been manufacturing?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the ground, sir.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;On the ground!&nbsp; And are ye for turning earth into heaven
among your other trades?&rdquo;&nbsp; What this might mean Jan knew
not; but he led his friend round, and pointed out the features of his
leaf-picture.&nbsp; He hoped for praise, but the old man was silent,
- long silent, though he seemed to be looking at what Jan showed him.&nbsp;
And when he did speak, his broken words were addressed to no one.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Wonderful! wonderful!&nbsp; The poetry of &rsquo;t.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
no child&rsquo;s play, this.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s genius.&nbsp; Ay! we mun
see to it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, with clasped hands, he cried, &ldquo;Good
Lord!&nbsp; Have I found him at last?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Have you lost something?&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
But the old man did not answer.&nbsp; He did not even speak of the leaf-picture,
to Jan&rsquo;s chagrin.&nbsp; But, stroking the boy&rsquo;s shoulder
almost tenderly, he asked, &ldquo;Did ye ever go to school, laddie?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;At Dame Datchett&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah! ye were sorry to leave school for pig-minding, weren&rsquo;t
ye?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I likes pigs,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I axed Master Salter to let me mind his.&nbsp; I gets a shilling
a week and me tea.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But ye like school better?&nbsp; Ye love your books, don&rsquo;t
ye?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan shook his head again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like school,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I likes being in the wood.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The old man winced as if some one had struck him in the face, then he
muttered, &ldquo;The wood!&nbsp; Ay, to be sure!&nbsp; And such a school,
too!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then he suddenly addressed Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do ye know me, my lad?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Swift - Master Swift, they call me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve heard
tell of Master Swift, the schoolmaster?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan shrank back.&nbsp; He had heard of Master Swift as a man whose stick
was more to be dreaded than Dame Datchett&rsquo;s strap, and of his
school as a place where liberty was less than with the Dame.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;See thee!&rdquo; said the old man, speaking broader and broader
in his earnestness.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thy father would send thee, - nay,
what am I saying? - if I took thee for naught and gladly, thou&rsquo;dst
sooner come to the old schoolmaster and his books than stay with pigs,
even in a wood?&nbsp; Eh, laddie?&nbsp; Will ye come to school?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But the tradition of Master Swift&rsquo;s severity was strong in Jan&rsquo;s
mind, and the wood was pleasant to him, and he only shrank back farther,
and said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; Children often give pain to their
elders, of the intensity of which they have no measure; but, had Jan
been older and wiser than he was, he might have been puzzled by the
bitterness of the disappointment written on Master Swift&rsquo;s countenance.<br>
<br>
An involuntary impulse made the old man break the blow by doing something.&nbsp;
With trembling fingers he folded his spectacles, and crammed them into
the shagreen case.&nbsp; But, when that was done, he still found nothing
to say, and he turned his back and went away in silence.<br>
<br>
In silence Jan watched him, half regretfully, and strained his ears
to catch something that Master Swift began again to recite: -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Things
sort not to my will,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when my will doth study Thy
renown:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou turn&rsquo;st the edge of all
things on me still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking me up to throw me down.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then, lifting a heavy bramble that had fallen across his path, the schoolmaster
stooped under it, and passed from sight.<br>
<br>
And a sudden gust of wind coming sharply down the way by which he went
caught the fragments of Jan&rsquo;s picture, and whirled them broadcast
through the wood.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XX.<br>
<br>
SQUIRE AMMABY AND HIS DAUGHTER. - THE CHEAP JACK DOES BUSINESS ONCE
MORE. - THE WHITE HORSE CHANGES MASTERS.<br>
<br>
Squire Ammaby was the most good-natured of men.&nbsp; He was very fond
of his wife, though she was somewhat peevish, with weak health and nerves,
and though she seemed daily less able to bear the rough and ready attentions
of her husband, and to rely more and more on the advice and assistance
of her mother, Lady Craikshaw.&nbsp; From this it came about that the
Squire&rsquo;s affection for his wife took the shape of wishing Lady
Louisa to have every thing that she wished for, and that the very joy
of his heart was his little daughter Amabel.<br>
<br>
Amabel was between three and four years old, and to some extent a prodigy.&nbsp;
She was as tall as an average child of six or seven, and stout in proportion.&nbsp;
The size of her shoes scandalized her grandmother, and once drew tears
from Lady Louisa as she reflected on the probable size of Miss Ammaby&rsquo;s
feet by the time she was &ldquo;presented.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Lady Louisa was tall and weedy; the Squire was tall and robust.&nbsp;
Amabel inherited height on both sides, but in face and in character
she was more like her father than her mother.&nbsp; Indeed, Lady Louisa
would close her eyes, and Lady Craikshaw would put up her gold glass
at the child, and they would both cry, &ldquo;Sadly coarse!&nbsp; <i>Quite
an Ammaby!</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; Amabel was not coarse, however; but she
had a strength and originality of character that must have come from
some bygone generation, if it was inherited.&nbsp; She had a pitying
affection for her mother.&nbsp; With her grandmother she lived at daggers
drawn.&nbsp; She kept up a pretty successful struggle for her own way
in the nursery.&nbsp; She was devoted to her father, when she could
get at him, and she poured an almost boundless wealth of affection on
every animal that came in her way.<br>
<br>
An uncle had just given her a Spanish saddle, and her father had promised
to buy her a donkey.&nbsp; He had heard of one, and was going to drive
to the town to see the owner.&nbsp; With great difficulty Amabel had
got permission from her mother and grandmother to go with the Squire
in the pony carriage.&nbsp; As she had faithfully promised to &ldquo;be
good,&rdquo; she submitted to be &ldquo;well wrapped up,&rdquo; under
her grandmother&rsquo;s direction, and staggered downstairs in coat,
cape, gaiters, comforter, muffatees, and with a Shetland veil over her
burning cheeks.&nbsp; She even displayed a needless zeal by carrying
a big shawl in a lump in her arms, which she would give up to no one.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she cried, as the Squire tried to take it from
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lift me in, daddy, lift me in!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Squire laughed, and obeyed her, saying, &ldquo;Why, bless my soul,
Amabel, I think you grow heavier every day.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Amabel came up crimson from some disposal of the shawl after her own
ideas, and her eyes twinkled as he spoke, though her fat cheeks kept
their gravity.&nbsp; It was not till they were far on their way that
a voice from below the seat cried, &ldquo;Yap!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s one of the dogs in the carriage,&rdquo; said
the Squire.<br>
<br>
On which, clinging to one of his arms and caressing him, Amabel confessed,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the pug, dear daddy.&nbsp; I brought him in under
the shawl.&nbsp; I did so want him to have a treat too.&nbsp; And grandmamma
is so hard!&nbsp; She hardly thinks I ought to have treats, and she
<i>never</i> thinks of treats for the dogs.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Squire only laughed, and said she must take care of the dog when
they got to the town; and Amabel was encouraged to ask if she might
take off the Shetland veil.&nbsp; Hesitating between his fear of Amabel&rsquo;s
catching cold, and a common-sense conviction that it was ludicrous to
dress her according to her invalid mother&rsquo;s susceptibilities,
the Squire was relieved from the responsibility of deciding by Amabel&rsquo;s
promptly exposing her rosy cheeks to the breeze, and they drove on happily
to the town.&nbsp; The Squire had business with the Justices, and Amabel
was left at the Crown.&nbsp; When he came back, Amabel jumped down from
the window and the black blind over which she was peeping into the yard,
and ran up to her father with tears on her face.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, daddy!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;dear, good daddy!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want you to buy me a donkey, I want you to buy me a horse.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s modest!&rdquo; said the Squire; &ldquo;but what
are you crying for?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s such a poor horse!&nbsp; Such a very old, poor
horse!&rdquo; cried Amabel.&nbsp; And from the window Mr. Ammaby was
able to confirm her statements.&nbsp; It was the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
white horse, which he had been trying to persuade the landlord to buy
as a cab-horse.&nbsp; More lean, more scarred, more drooping than ever,
it was a pitiful sight, now and then raising its soft nose and intelligent
eyes to the window, as if it knew what a benevolent little being was
standing on a slippery chair, with her arms round the Squire&rsquo;s
neck, pleading its cause.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But when I buy horses,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;I buy young,
good ones, not very old and poor ones.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, but do buy it, daddy!&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s not had enough
to eat, like that kitten I found in the ditch.&nbsp; And perhaps it&rsquo;ll
get fat, like her; and mamma said we wanted an old horse to go in the
cart for luggage, and I&rsquo;m sure that one&rsquo;s very old.&nbsp;
And that&rsquo;s such a horrid man, like hump-backed Richard.&nbsp;
And when nobody&rsquo;s looking, he tugs it, and beats it.&nbsp; Oh,
I wish I could beat him!&rdquo; and Amabel danced dangerously upon the
horsehair seat in her white gaiters with impotent indignation.&nbsp;
The Squire was very weak when pressed by his daughter, but at horses,
if at any thing, he looked with an eye to business.&nbsp; To buy such
a creature would be ludicrous.&nbsp; Still, Amabel had made a strong
point by what Lady Louisa had said.&nbsp; No one, too, knew better than
the Squire what difference good and bad treatment can make in a horse,
and this one had been good once, as his experienced eye told him.&nbsp;
He said he &ldquo;would see,&rdquo; and strolled into the yard.<br>
<br>
Long practice had given the Cheap Jack a quickness in detecting a possible
purchaser which almost amounted to an extra sense, and he at once began
to assail the Squire.&nbsp; But a nearer view of the white horse had
roused Mr. Ammaby&rsquo;s indignation.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re not ashamed
to exhibit a poor beast that&rsquo;s been so ill-treated.&nbsp; For
heaven&rsquo;s sake, take it to the knacker&rsquo;s, and put it out
of its misery at once.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Look ye, my lord,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack, touching his cap.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The horse have been ill-treated, I knows.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an
afflicted man, my lord, and the boy I&rsquo;ve employed, he&rsquo;s
treated him shameful; and when a man can&rsquo;t feed hisself, he can&rsquo;t
keep his beast fat neither.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I wants to get rid
on him, my lord.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t keep him as I should, and I&rsquo;d
like to see him with a gentleman like yourself as&rsquo;ll do him justice.&nbsp;
He comes of a good stock, my lord.&nbsp; Take him for fifteen pound,&rdquo;
he added, waddling up to the Squire, &ldquo;and when you&rsquo;ve had
him three months, you&rsquo;ll sell him for thirty.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This was too much.&nbsp; The Squire broke out in a furious rage.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You unblushing scoundrel!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye
think I&rsquo;m a fool?&nbsp; Fifteen pounds for a horse you should
be fined for keeping alive!&nbsp; Be off with it, and put it out of
misery.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned indignantly into the inn, the Cheap
Jack calling after him, &ldquo;Say ten pound, my lord!&rdquo; the bystanders
giggling, and the ostler whistling dryly through the straw in his mouth,
&ldquo;Take it to the knacker&rsquo;s, Cheap John.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, daddy dear! have you got him?&rdquo; cried Amabel, as the
Squire re-entered the parlor.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, my dear; the poor beast isn&rsquo;t fit to draw carts, my
darling.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been so badly treated, the only kindness now
is to kill it, and put it out of pain.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve told the
hunchback so.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was a matter of course and humanity to the Squire, but it overwhelmed
poor Amabel.&nbsp; She gasped, &ldquo;Kill it!&rdquo; and then bursting
into a flood of tears she danced on the floor, wringing her hands and
crying, &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh! don&rsquo;t, <i>please</i>, don&rsquo;t let
him be killed!&nbsp; Oh! do, do buy him and let him die comfortably
in the paddock.&nbsp; Oh, do, do, do!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nonsense, Amabel, you mustn&rsquo;t dance like that.&nbsp; Remember,
you promised to be good,&rdquo; said the Squire.&nbsp; The child gulped
down her tears, and stood quite still, with her face pale from very
misery.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want not to be good,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,
oh dear, I do wish I had some money, that I might buy that poor old
horse, and let him die comfortably at home.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was not the money the Squire grudged; it was against all his instincts
to buy a bad horse.&nbsp; But Amabel&rsquo;s wan face overcame him,
and he went out again.&nbsp; He never lingered over disagreeable business,
and, going straight up to the Cheap Jack, he said, &ldquo;My little
girl is so distressed about it, that I&rsquo;ll give you five pounds
for the poor brute, to stop its sufferings.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Say eight, my lord,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack.&nbsp; Once more
the Squire was turning away in wrath, when he caught sight of Amabel&rsquo;s
face at the window.&nbsp; He turned back, and, biting his lip, said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you five pounds if you&rsquo;ll take it now,
and go.&nbsp; If you beat me down again, I&rsquo;ll offer you four.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take off a pound for every bate you utter; and, when I speak,
I mean what I say.&nbsp; Do you think I don&rsquo;t know one horse from
another?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It is probable that the Cheap Jack would have made another effort to
better his bargain, but his wife had come to seek him, and to her sharp
eyes the Squire&rsquo;s resolution was beyond mistake.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the five guineas, and thank you, sir,&rdquo;
she said, courtesying.&nbsp; The Squire did not care to dispute the
five shillings which she had dexterously added, and he paid the sum,
and the worthy couple went away.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Miles!&rdquo; said the Squire.&nbsp; The servant he had brought
with him in reference to the donkey appeared, and touched his hat.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Miss Amabel has persuaded me to buy this poor brute, that it
may die in peace in the paddock.&nbsp; Can you get it home, d&rsquo;ye
think?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I think I can, sir, this evening; after a feed and some rest.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The white horse had suddenly become a centre of interest in the inn-yard.&nbsp;
Everybody, from the landlord to the stable-boy, felt its legs, and patted
it, and suggested various lines of treatment.<br>
<br>
Before he drove away, Mr. Ammaby overheard the landlord saying, &ldquo;He
be a sharp hand, is the Squire.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he
brought the beast round yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which, for his credit&rsquo;s
sake, the Squire devoutly hoped he might.&nbsp; But, after all, he had
his reward when Amabel, sobbing with joy, flung her arms round him,
and cried, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, you dear, darling, <i>good</i> daddy!&nbsp; How I love you
and how the white horse loves you!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXI.<br>
<br>
MASTER SWIFT AT HOME. - RUFUS. - THE EX-PIG-MINDER. - JAN AND THE SCHOOLMASTER.<br>
<br>
It was a lovely autumn evening the same year, when the school having
broken up for the day, Master Swift returned to his home for tea.&nbsp;
He lived in a tiny cottage on the opposite side of the water-meadows
to that on which Dame Datchett dwelt, and farther down towards the water-mill.&nbsp;
He had neither wife nor child, but a red dog with a plaintive face,
and the name of Rufus, kept his house when he was absent, and kept him
company when he was at home.<br>
<br>
Rufus was a mongrel.&nbsp; He was not a red setter, though his coloring
was similar.&nbsp; A politely disposed person would have called him
a retriever, and his curly back and general appearance might have carried
this off, but for his tail, which, instead of being straight and rat-like,
was as plumy as the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s feathers, and curled unblushingly
over his back, sideways, like a pug&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a good
one to wag,&rdquo; his master said, and, apart from the question of
high breeding, it was handsome, and Rufus himself seemed proud of it.<br>
<br>
Since half-past three had Rufus sat in the porch, blinking away positive
sleep, with his pathetic face towards the road down which Master Swift
must come.&nbsp; Unnecessarily pathetic, for there was every reason
for his being the most jovial of dogs, and not one for that imposing
melancholy which he wore.&nbsp; His large level eyelids shaded the pupils
even when he was broad awake; an intellectual forehead, and a very long
Vandykish nose, with the curly ears, which fell like a well-dressed
peruke on each side of his face, gave him an air of disinherited royalty.&nbsp;
But he was in truth a mongrel, living on the fat of the land; who, from
the day that this wistful dignity had won the schoolmaster&rsquo;s heart,
had never known a care, wanted a meal, or had any thing whatever demanded
of him but to sit comfortably at home and watch with a broken-hearted
countenance for the schoolmaster&rsquo;s return from the labors which
supported them both.&nbsp; The sunshine made Rufus sleepy, but he kept
valiantly watchful, propping himself against the garden-tools which
stood in the corner.&nbsp; Flowers and vegetables for eating were curiously
mixed in the little garden that lay about Master Swift&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp;
Not a corner was wasted in it, and a thick hedge of sweet-peas formed
a fragrant fence from the outer world.<br>
<br>
Rufus was nodding, when he heard a footstep.&nbsp; He pulled himself
up, but he did not wag his tail, for the step was not the schoolmaster&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
It was Jan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Rufus growled slightly, and Jan stood outside,
and called, &ldquo;Master Swift!&rdquo;&nbsp; He and Rufus both paused
and listened, but the schoolmaster did not appear.&nbsp; Then Rufus
came out and smelt Jan exhaustively, and excepting a slight flavor of
being acquainted with cats, to whom Rufus objected, he smelt well.&nbsp;
Rufus wagged his tail, Jan patted him, and they sat down to wait for
the master.<br>
<br>
The clock in the old square-towered church had struck a quarter-past
four when Master Swift came down the lane, and Rufus rushed out to meet
him.&nbsp; Though Rufus told him in so many barks that there was a stranger
within, and that, as he smelt respectable, he had allowed him to wait,
the schoolmaster was startled by the sight of Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s the little pig-minder!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
On which Jan&rsquo;s face crimsoned, and tears welled up in his black
eyes.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I bean&rsquo;t a pig-minder now, Master Swift,&rdquo; said he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s that?&nbsp; Has Master Salter turned ye off?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I gi&rsquo;ed <i>him</i> notice!&rdquo; said Jan, indignantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I shan&rsquo;t mind pigs no more, Master Swift&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And why not, Master Skymaker?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee laugh, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Master
Salter he laughs.&nbsp; &rsquo;What&rsquo;s pigs for but to be killed?&rsquo;
says he.&nbsp; But I axed him not to kill the little black un with the
white spot on his ear.&nbsp; It be such a nice pig, sir, such a very
nice pig!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the tears flowed copiously down Jan&rsquo;s
cheeks, whilst Rufus looked abjectly depressed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would
follow me anywhere, and come when I called,&rdquo; Jan continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I told Master Salter it be &rsquo;most as good as a dog, to keep
the rest together.&nbsp; But a says &rsquo;tis the fattest, and &rsquo;ull
be the first to kill.&nbsp; And then I telled him to find another boy
to mind his pigs, for I couldn&rsquo;t look un in the face now, and
know &rsquo;twas to be killed next month, not that one with the white
spot on his ear.&nbsp; It do be such a <i>very</i> nice pig!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Rufus licked up the tears as they fell over Jan&rsquo;s smock, and the
schoolmaster took Jan in and comforted him.&nbsp; Jan dried his eyes
at last, and helped to prepare for tea.&nbsp; The old man made some
very good coffee in a shaving-pot, and put cold bacon and bread upon
the table, and the three sat down to their meal.&nbsp; Jan and his host
upon two rush-bottomed chairs, whilst Rufus scrambled into an armchair
placed for his accommodation, from whence he gazed alternately at the
schoolmaster and the victuals with sad, not to say reproachful, eyes.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I thought that would be your chair,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, it used to be,&rdquo; said Master Swift, apologetically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But the poor beast can&rsquo;t sit well on these, and I relish
my meat better with a face on the other side of the table.&nbsp; He
found that too slippery at first, till I bought yon bit of a patchwork-cushion
for him at a sale.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Rufus sighed, and Master Swift gave him a piece of bread, which, having
smelt, he allowed to lie before him on the table till his master, laughing,
rubbed the bread against the bacon, with which additional flavor Rufus
seemed content, and ate his supper.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come to the old schoolmaster, after all?&rdquo;
said Master Swift: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right, my lad, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Abel sent me,&rdquo; said Jan; &ldquo;he said I was
to take to my books.&nbsp; So I come because Abel axed me.&nbsp; For
I be main fond of Abel.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Abel was right,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take to
learning, my lad.&nbsp; Love your books, - friends that nobody can kill,
or part ye from.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to learn pieces like them you say,&rdquo; said
Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So ye shall, so ye shall!&rdquo; cried Master Swift.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a fine thing, is learning poetry.&nbsp; It strengthens the memory, and
cultivates the higher faculties.&nbsp; Take some more bacon, my lad.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Which Jan did.&nbsp; At that moment he was not reflecting on his doomed
friend, the spotted pig.&nbsp; Indeed, if we reflected about every thing,
this present state of existence would become intolerable.<br>
<br>
At much length did the schoolmaster speak on the joys of learning, and,
pointing proudly to a few shelves filled by his savings, he formally
made Jan &ldquo;free of&rdquo; his books.&nbsp; &ldquo;When ye&rsquo;ve
learnt to read them,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; Jan thanked him for this,
and for leave to visit him.&nbsp; But he looked out of the window instead
of at the book-shelves.<br>
<br>
Beyond Master Swift&rsquo;s gay flowers stretched the rich green of
the water-meads, glowing yellow in the sunlight.&nbsp; The little river
hardly seemed to move in its zig-zag path, though the evening breeze
was strong enough to show the silver side of the willows that drooped
over it.&nbsp; Jan wondered if he could match all these tints in the
wood, and whether Master Swift would be willing to have leaf-pictures
painted on that table in the window.&nbsp; Then he found that the old
man was speaking, though he only heard the latter part of what he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo; - a celebrated inventor and mechanic, and that&rsquo;s what
you&rsquo;ll be, maybe.&nbsp; Ay, ay, a Great Man, please the Lord;
and, when I&rsquo;m laid by in the churchyard yonder, folks&rsquo;ll
come to see the grave of old Swift, the great man&rsquo;s schoolmaster.&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;ll be an inventor yet, lad, a benefactor to your kind, and
an honor to your country.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not raising false hopes in
ye, without observing your qualities.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve the quick eye,
the slow patience, and the inventive spark.&nbsp; You can find your
own tools and all, and don&rsquo;t stop where other folk leaves off:
witness yon bluebells ye took to make skies with!&nbsp; But, bless the
lad, he&rsquo;s not heeding me!&nbsp; Is it the bit of garden you&rsquo;re
looking at?&nbsp; Come out then.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, putting the biography
back in the book-shelf, the kindly old man led Jan out of doors.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Say what you said in the wood again,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
But Master Swift laughed, and, stretching his hand towards the sweet-peas
hedge began at another part of the poem: -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here are sweet peas on tiptoe for
a flight:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wings of gentle flush o&rsquo;er
delicate white,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And taper fingers catching at all
things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bind them all about with tiny
rings.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then, bending towards the river, he continued in a theatrical whisper:
-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How silent comes the water round
that bend!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the minutest whisper does it
send<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the o&rsquo;erhanging sallows&rdquo;
-<br>
<br>
But here he stopped suddenly, though Jan&rsquo;s black eyes were at
their roundest, and his attention almost breathless.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There, there!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an old fool, and for making you
as bad.&nbsp; Poetry&rsquo;s not your business, you understand: I&rsquo;m
giving ye no encouragement to dabble with the fine arts.&nbsp; Science
is the ladder for a working-man to climb to fame.&nbsp; In addition
to which, the poet Keats, though he certainly speaks the very language
of Nature, was a bit of a heathen, I&rsquo;m afraid, and the fascination
of him might be injurious in tender youth.&nbsp; Never mind, child,
if ye love poetry, I&rsquo;ll learn ye pieces by the poet Herbert.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re just true poetry, and manly, too; and they&rsquo;re a
fountain of experimental religion.&nbsp; And, if this style is too sober
for your fancy, Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns are touched with the very
fire of religious passion.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Are your folk religious, Jan?&rdquo; he added, abruptly.&nbsp;
And whilst Jan stood puzzling the question, he asked with an almost
official air of authority, &ldquo;Do ye any of ye come to church?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My father does on club-days,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And the rest of ye, - do ye attend any place of worship?&rdquo;
Jan shook his head.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll dare to say ye didn&rsquo;t know I was the clerk?&rdquo;
said Master Swift.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s paganism for ye in a Christian
parish!&nbsp; Well, well, you&rsquo;re coming to me, lad, and, apart
from your secular studies, you&rsquo;ll be instructed in the Word of
GOD, and in the Church Catechism on Fridays.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.&nbsp; He felt this civility
to be due, though of the schoolmaster&rsquo;s plans for his benefit
he had a very confused notion.&nbsp; He then took leave.&nbsp; Rufus
went with him to the gate, and returned to his master with a look which
plainly said, &ldquo;We could have done with him very well, if you had
kept him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
When Jan had reached a bit of rising ground, from which the house he
had just left was visible, he turned round to look at it again.<br>
<br>
Master Swift was standing where he had left him, gazing out into the
distance with painful intensity.&nbsp; The fast-sinking sun lit up his
heavy face and figure with a transforming glow, and hung a golden mist
above the meads, at which he stared like one spellbound.&nbsp; But when
Jan turned to pursue his way to the windmill, the schoolmaster turned
also, and went back into the cottage.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXII.<br>
<br>
THE PARISH CHURCH. - REMBRANDT. - THE SNOW SCENE. - MASTER SWIFT&rsquo;S
AUTOBIOGRAPHY.<br>
<br>
In most respects, Jan&rsquo;s conduct and progress were very satisfactory.&nbsp;
He quickly learned to read, and his copy-books were models.<br>
<br>
The good clerk developed another talent in him.&nbsp; Jan learned to
sing, and to sing very well; and he was put into the choir-seats in
the old church, where he sang with enthusiasm hymns which he had learned
by heart from the schoolmaster.<br>
<br>
No wild weather that ever blustered over the downs could keep Jan now
from the services.&nbsp; The old church came to have a fascination for
him, from the low, square tower without, round which the rooks wheeled,
to the springing pillars, the solemn gray tints of the stone, and the
round arches that so gratified the eye within.&nbsp; And did he not
sit opposite to the one stained window the soldiers of the Commonwealth
had spared to the parish!&nbsp; It was the only colored picture Jan
knew, and he knew every line, every tint of it, and the separate expression
on each of the wan, quaint faces of the figures.&nbsp; When the sun
shone, they seemed to smile at him, and their ruby dresses glowed like
garments dyed in blood.&nbsp; When the colors fell upon Abel&rsquo;s
white head, Jan wished with all his heart that he could have gathered
them as he gathered leaves, to make pictures with.&nbsp; Sometimes he
day-dreamed that one of the figures came down out of the window, and
brought the colors with him, and that he and Jan painted pictures in
the other windows, filling them with gorgeous hues, and pale, devout
faces.&nbsp; The fancy, empty as it was, pleased him, and he planned
how every window should be done, and told Abel, to whom the ingenious
fancy seemed as marvellous as if the work had been accomplished.<br>
<br>
Abel was in the choir too, not so much because of his voice as of his
great wish for it, and of the example of his good behavior.&nbsp; It
was he who persuaded Mrs. Lake to come to church, and having once begun
she came often.&nbsp; She tried to persuade her husband to go, and told
him how sweetly the boys&rsquo; voices sounded, led by Master Swift&rsquo;s
fine bass, which he pitched from a key which he knocked upon his desk.&nbsp;
But Master Lake had a proverb to excuse him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The nearer
the church, the further from GOD.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not that he pretended
to maintain the converse of the proposition.<br>
<br>
Jan learned plenty of poetry; hymns, which Abel learned again from him,
some of Herbert&rsquo;s poems, and bits of Keats.&nbsp; But his favorites
were martial poems by Mrs. Hemans, which he found in an old volume of
collected verses, till the day he came upon &ldquo;Marmion,&rdquo; and
gave himself up to Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp; He spouted poetry to Abel
in imitation of Master Swift, and they enjoyed all, and understood about
half.<br>
<br>
And yet Jan&rsquo;s progress was not altogether satisfactory to his
teacher.<br>
<br>
To learn long pieces of poetry was easy pastime to him, but he was dull
or inattentive when the schoolmaster gave him some elementary lessons
in mechanics.&nbsp; He wrote beautifully, but was no prodigy in arithmetic.&nbsp;
He drew trees, windmills, and pigs on the desks, and admirable portraits
of the schoolmaster, Rufus, and other local worthies, on the margins
of the tables of weights and measures.<br>
<br>
Much of his leisure was spent at Master Swift&rsquo;s cottage, and in
reading his books.&nbsp; The schoolmaster had marked an old biographical
dictionary at pages containing lives of &ldquo;self-made&rdquo; men,
who had risen as inventors or improvers in mechanics or as discoverers
of important facts of natural science.&nbsp; Jan had not hitherto studied
their careers with the avidity Master Swift would have liked to see,
but one day he found him reading the fat volume with deep interest.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And whose life are ye at now, laddie?&rdquo; he asked, with a
smile.<br>
<br>
Jan lifted his face, which was glowing.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Rembrandt
the painter I be reading about.&nbsp; Eh, Master Swift, he lived in
a windmill, and he was a miller&rsquo;s son!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;d a miller&rsquo;s thumb,&rdquo; Jan added, stretching
out his own, and smiling at the droll idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do &rsquo;ee
know what <i>etchings</i> be, then, Master Swift?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A kind of picture that&rsquo;s scratched on a piece of copper
with needles, and costs a lot of money to print,&rdquo; said Master
Swift, dryly; and he turned his broad back and went out.<br>
<br>
It was one day in the second winter of Jan&rsquo;s learning under Master
Swift that matters came to a climax.&nbsp; The schoolmaster loved punctuality,
but Jan was not always punctual.&nbsp; He was generally better in this
respect in winter than in summer, as there was less to distract his
attention on the road to school.&nbsp; But one winter&rsquo;s day he
loitered to make a sketch on his slate, and made matters worse by putting
finishing touches to it after he was seated at the desk.<br>
<br>
It was not a day to suggest sketching, but, turning round when he was
about half way to the village, the view seemed to Jan to be exactly
suitable for a slate sketch.&nbsp; The long slopes of the downs were
white with snow; but it was a dull grayish white, for there was no sunshine,
and the gray-white of the slate-pencil did it justice enough.&nbsp;
In the middle distance rose the windmill, and a thatched cattle shed
and some palings made an admirable foreground.&nbsp; On the top and
edges of these lay the snow, outlining them in white, which again the
slate-pencil could imitate effectively.&nbsp; There only wanted something
darker than the slate itself to do those parts of the foreground and
the mill which looked darker than the sky, and for this Jan trusted
to pen and ink when he reached his desk.&nbsp; The drawing was very
successful, and Jan was so absorbed in admiring it that he did not notice
the schoolmaster&rsquo;s approach, but feeling some one behind him,
he fancied it was one of the boys, and held up the slate triumphantly,
whispering, &ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee here!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was Master Swift who looked, and snatching the slate he brought it
down on the sharp corner of the desk, and broke it to pieces.&nbsp;
Then he went back to his place, and spoke neither bad nor good to Jan
for the rest of the school-time.&nbsp; Jan would much rather have been
beaten.&nbsp; Once or twice he made essay to go up to Master Swift&rsquo;s
desk, but the old man&rsquo;s stern countenance discouraged him, and
he finally shrank into a corner and sat weeping bitterly.&nbsp; He sat
there till every scholar but himself had gone, and still the schoolmaster
did not speak.&nbsp; Jan slunk out, and when Master Swift turned homewards
Jan followed silently in his footsteps through the snow.&nbsp; At the
door of the cottage, the old man looked round with a relenting face.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I suppose Rufus&rsquo;ll insist on your coming in,&rdquo; said
he; and Jan rushing in hid his face in Rufus&rsquo;s curls, and sobbed
heavily.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; said the schoolmaster.&nbsp; &ldquo;No more
of that, child.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s bitters enough in life, without
being so prodigal of your tears.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Come and sit down with ye,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
very young, lad, and maybe I&rsquo;m foolish to be angry with ye that
you&rsquo;re not wise.&nbsp; But yet ye&rsquo;ve more sense than your
years in some respects, and I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll try and make
ye see things as I see &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to tell ye something
about myself, if ye&rsquo;d care to hear it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be main pleased, Master Swift,&rdquo; said Jan, earnestly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d none of your advantages, lad,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I was your age, I knew more mischief than you need ever
know, and uncommon little else.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a self-educated man,
- I used to hope I should live to hear folk say a self-made Great Man.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a bitter thing to have the ambition without the genius, to
smoulder in the fire that great men shine by!&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s
something to have just the saving sense to know that ye&rsquo;ve not
got it, though it&rsquo;s taken a wasted lifetime to convince me, and
I sometimes think the deceiving serpent is more scotched than killed
yet.&nbsp; However, ye seem to me to be likelier to lack the ambition
than the genius, so we may let that bide.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s a
snare of mine, Jan, that I mean your feet to be free of, and that&rsquo;s
a mischosen vocation.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a native of these parts, ye
must know.&nbsp; I come from the north, and in those mining and manufacturing
districts I&rsquo;ve seen many a man that&rsquo;s got an education,
and could keep himself sober, rise to own his house and his works, and
have men under him, and bring up his children like the gentry.&nbsp;
For mark ye, my lad.&nbsp; In such matters the experiences of the early
part of an artisan&rsquo;s life are all so much to the good for him,
for they&rsquo;re in the working of the trade, and the finest young
gentleman has got it all to learn, if he wants to make money in that
line.&nbsp; I got my education, and I was sober enough, but - Heaven
help me - I must be a poet, and in <i>that</i> line a gentleman&rsquo;s
son knows almost from the nursery many a thing that I had to teach myself
with hard labor as a man.&nbsp; It was just a madness.&nbsp; But I read
all the poetry I could lay my hands on, and I wrote as well.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Did you write poetry, Master Swift?&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, Jan, of a sort.&nbsp; At one time I worshipped Burns.&nbsp;
And then I wrote verses in the dialect of my native place, which, ye
must know, I can speak with any man when I&rsquo;ve a mind,&rdquo; said
Master Swift, unconscious that he spoke it always.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
then it was Wordsworth, for the love of nature is just a passion with
me, and it&rsquo;s that that made the poet Keats a new world to me.&nbsp;
Well, well, now I&rsquo;m telling you how I came here.&nbsp; It was
after my wife.&nbsp; She was lady&rsquo;s-maid to Squire Ammaby&rsquo;s
mother, and the old Squire got me the school.&nbsp; Ah, those were happy
days!&nbsp; I was a godless, rough sort of a fellow when she married
me, but I became a converted man.&nbsp; And let me tell ye, lad, when
a man and wife love GOD and each other, and live in the country, a bit
of ground like this becomes a very garden of Eden.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Did your wife like your poetry, sir?&rdquo; said Jan, on whom
the idea that the schoolmaster was a poet made a strong impression.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, Jan.&nbsp; She was a good scholar.&nbsp; I wrote a bit
about that time called Love and Ambition, in the style of the poet Wordsworth.&nbsp;
It was as much as to say that Love had killed Ambition, ye understand?&nbsp;
But it wasn&rsquo;t dead.&nbsp; It had only shifted to another object.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We had a child.&nbsp; I remember the first day his blue eyes
looked at me with what I may call sense in &rsquo;em.&nbsp; He was in
his cradle, and there was no one but me with him.&nbsp; I went on like
a fool.&nbsp; &rsquo;See thee, my son,&rsquo; I said, &rsquo;thy father&rsquo;s
been a bad &rsquo;un, but he&rsquo;ll keep thee as pure as thy mother.&nbsp;
Thy father&rsquo;s a poor scholar, but he&rsquo;s not <i>that</i> dull
but what he&rsquo;ll make <i>thee</i> as learned as the parson.&nbsp;
Thy father&rsquo;s a needy man, a man in a small way, but he and thy
mother&rsquo;ll stick here in this dull bit of a village, content, ay,
my lad, right happy, so thou&rsquo;rt a rich man, and can see the world!&rsquo;&nbsp;
I give ye my word, Jan, the child looked at me as if he understood it
all.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re wondering, maybe, what made me hope he&rsquo;d
do different to what I&rsquo;d done.&nbsp; But, ye see, his mother was
just an angel, and I reckoned he&rsquo;d be half like her.&nbsp; Then
she&rsquo;d lived with gentlefolks from a child, and knew manners and
such like that I never learned.&nbsp; And for as little as I&rsquo;d
taught myself, he&rsquo;d at any rate begin where his father left off.&nbsp;
He was all we had.&nbsp; There seemed no fault in him.&nbsp; His mother
dressed him like a little prince, and his manners were the same.&nbsp;
Ah, we <i>were</i> happy!&nbsp; Then&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, Master Swift?&rdquo; said Jan, for the schoolmaster had
paused.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t ye see the place is empty?&rdquo; he answered sharply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who takes bite or sup with me but Rufus?&nbsp; <i>She died</i>.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have gone mad but for the boy.&nbsp; All my thought
was to make up her loss to him.&nbsp; A child learns a man to be unselfish,
Jan.&nbsp; I used to think, &rsquo;GOD may well be the very fount of
unselfish charity, when He has so many children, so helpless without
Him!&rsquo;&nbsp; I think He taught me how to do for that boy.&nbsp;
I dressed him, I darned his socks: what work I couldn&rsquo;t do I put
out, but I had no one in.&nbsp; When I came in from school, I cleaned
myself, and changed my boots, to give him his meals.&nbsp; Rufus and
I eat off the table now, but I give ye my word when he was alive we&rsquo;d
three clean cloths a week, and he&rsquo;d a pinny every day; and there&rsquo;s
a silver fork and spoon in yon drawer I saved up to buy him, and had
his name put on.&nbsp; I taught him too.&nbsp; He loved poetry as well
as his father.&nbsp; He could say most of Milton&rsquo;s &rsquo;Lycidas.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It was an unlucky thing to have learned him too!&nbsp; Eh, Jan! we&rsquo;re
poor fools.&nbsp; I lay awake night after night reconciling my mind
to troubles that were never to come, and never dreaming of what <i>was</i>
before me.&nbsp; I thought to myself, &rsquo;John Swift, my lad, you&rsquo;re
making yourself a bed of thorns.&nbsp; As sure as you make your son
a gentleman, so sure he&rsquo;ll look down on his old father when he
gets up.&nbsp; Can ye bear that, John Swift, and <i>her</i> dead, and
him all that ye have?&rsquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t ask myself twice,
Jan.&nbsp; Of course I could bear it.&nbsp; Would any parent stop his
child from being better than himself because he&rsquo;d be looked down
on?&nbsp; I never heard of one.&nbsp; &rsquo;I want him to think me
rough and ignorant,&rsquo; says I, &rsquo;for I want him to know what&rsquo;s
better.&nbsp; And I shan&rsquo;t expect him to think on how I&rsquo;ve
slaved for him, till he&rsquo;s children of his own, and their mother
a lady.&nbsp; But when I&rsquo;m dead,&rsquo; I says, &rsquo;and he
stands by my grave, and I can&rsquo;t shame him no more with my common
ways, he&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;The old man did his best for me,&rdquo;
for he has his mother&rsquo;s feelings.&rsquo;&nbsp; I tell ye, Jan,
I cried like a child to think of him standing at my burying in a good
black coat and a silk scarf like a gentleman, and I no more thought
of standing at his than if he was bound to live for ever.&nbsp; And,
mind ye, I did all I could to improve myself.&nbsp; I learned while
I was teaching, and read all I could lay my hands on.&nbsp; Books of
travels made me wild.&nbsp; I was young still, and I&rsquo;d have given
a deal to see the world.&nbsp; But I was saving every penny for him.&nbsp;
&rsquo;He&rsquo;ll see it all,&rsquo; says I, &rsquo;and that&rsquo;s
enough, - Italy and Greece, and Egypt, and the Holy Land.&nbsp; And
he&rsquo;ll see the sea (which I never saw but once, and that was at
Cleethorpes), and he&rsquo;ll go to the tropics, and see flowers that
&rsquo;ud just turn his old father&rsquo;s head, and he&rsquo;ll write
and tell me of &rsquo;em, for he&rsquo;s got his mother&rsquo;s feelings.&rsquo;
. . .&nbsp; My GOD!&nbsp; He never passed the parish bounds, and he&rsquo;s
lain alongside of her in yon churchyard for five and thirty years!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Master Swift&rsquo;s head sank upon his breast, and he was silent, as
if in a trance, but Jan dared not speak.&nbsp; The silence was broken
by Rufus, who got up and stuffed his nose into the schoolmaster&rsquo;s
hand.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Poor lad!&rdquo; said his master, patting him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou&rsquo;rt
a good soul, too!&nbsp; Well, Jan, I&rsquo;m here, ye see.&nbsp; It
didn&rsquo;t kill me.&nbsp; I was off my head a bit, I believe, but
they kept the school for me, and I got to work again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
rough pottery, lad, and take a deal of breaking.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve took
up with dumb animals, too, a good deal.&nbsp; At least, they&rsquo;ve
took up with me.&nbsp; Most of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s come, like Rufus, of
themselves.&nbsp; Mangy puppies no one would own, cats with kettles
to their tails, and so on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always had a bit of company
to my meals, and that&rsquo;s the main thing.&nbsp; Folks has said to
me, &rsquo;Master Swift, I don&rsquo;t know how you can keep on schooling.&nbsp;
I reckon you can hardly abide the sight of boys now you&rsquo;ve lost
your own.&rsquo;&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re wrong, Jan: it seemed to give
me a kind of love for every lad I lit upon.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Are ye thinking ambition was dead in the old man at last?&nbsp;
It came to life again, Jan.&nbsp; After a bit, I says to myself, &rsquo;In
a dull place like this there&rsquo;s doubtless many a boy that might
rise that never has the chance that I&rsquo;d have given to mine.&nbsp;
For what says the poet Gray? -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But Knowledge to their eyes her
ample page,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich with the spoils
of Time, did ne&rsquo;er unroll.&rdquo;&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I think, Jan, sometimes, I&rsquo;m like Rachel, who&rsquo;d rather
have taken to her servant&rsquo;s children than have had none.&nbsp;
I thought, &rsquo;If there&rsquo;s a genius in obscurity here, I&rsquo;ll
come across the boy, being schoolmaster, and I&rsquo;ll do for him as
I&rsquo;d have done for my own.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jan, I&rsquo;ve seen nigh
on seven generations of lads pass through this school, but <i>he&rsquo;s
never come!</i>&nbsp; Society&rsquo;s quit of that blame.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
been no &rsquo;mute, inglorious Miltons&rsquo; here since I come to
this place.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s been many a nice-tempered lad I&rsquo;ve
loved, for I&rsquo;m fond of children, but never one that yearned to
see places he&rsquo;d never seen, or to know things he&rsquo;d never
heard of.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no fool like an old one, and I think I&rsquo;ve
been more disappointed as time went on.&nbsp; I submitted myself to
the Lord&rsquo;s will years ago; but I <i>have</i> prayed Him, on my
knees, since He didn&rsquo;t see fit to raise me and mine, to let me
have that satisfaction to help some other man&rsquo;s son to knowledge
and to fame.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jan Lake,&rdquo; said Master Swift, &ldquo;when I found you in
yon wood, I found what I&rsquo;ve looked for in vain for thirty-five
years.&nbsp; Have I been schoolmaster so long, d&rsquo;ye think, and
don&rsquo;t know one boy&rsquo;s face from another?&nbsp; Lad? is it
possible ye don&rsquo;t <i>care</i> to be a great man?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan cared very much, but he was afraid of Master Swift; and it was by
an effort that he summoned up courage to say, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I be a great painter, Master Swift, don&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee think?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The old man frowned impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have I been telling
ye?&nbsp; The Fine Arts are not the road to fame for working-men.&nbsp;
Jan, Jan, be guided by me.&nbsp; Learn what I bid ye.&nbsp; And when
ye&rsquo;ve made name and fortune the way I show ye, ye can buy paints
and paintings at your will, and paint away to please your leisure hours.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It did not need the gentle Abel&rsquo;s after-counsel to persuade Jan
to submit himself to the schoolmaster&rsquo;s direction.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do as ye bid me, Master Swift; indeed, I will, sir,&rdquo;
said he.<br>
<br>
But, when the pleased old man rambled on of fame and fortune, it must
be confessed that Jan but thought of them as the steps to those hours
of wealthy leisure in which he could buy paints and indulge the irrepressible
bent of his genius without blame.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXIII.<br>
<br>
THE WHITE HORSE IN CLOVER. - AMABEL AND HER GUARDIANS. - AMABEL IN THE
WOOD. - BOGY.<br>
<br>
The white horse lived to see good days.&nbsp; He got safely home, and
spent the winter in a comfortable stable, with no work but being exercised
for the good of his health by the stable-boy.&nbsp; It was expensive,
but expense was not a first consideration with the Squire, and when
he had once decided a matter, he was not apt to worry himself with regrets.&nbsp;
As to Amabel the very narrowness of the white horse&rsquo;s escape from
death exalted him at once to the place of first favorite in her tender
heart, even over the head (and ears) of the new donkey.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Miss Amabel&rsquo;s&rdquo; interest in the cart-horse offended
her nurse&rsquo;s ideas of propriety, and met with no sympathy from
her mother or grandmother.&nbsp; But she was apt to get her own way;
and from time to time she appeared suddenly, like a fairy-imp, in the
stable, where she majestically directed the groom to hold her up whilst
she plied a currycomb on the old horse&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; This over,
she would ask with dignity, &ldquo;Do you take care of him, Miles?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And Miles, touching his cap, would reply, &ldquo;Certainly, miss, the
very greatest of care.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Amabel would add, &ldquo;Does
he get plenty to eat, do you think?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Plenties to
heat, miss,&rdquo; the groom would reply.&nbsp; And she generally closed
the conversation with, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
a good man, Miles.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In spring the white horse was turned out into the paddock, where Amabel
had begged that he might die comfortably.&nbsp; He lived comfortably
instead; and Amabel visited him constantly, and being perfectly fearless
would kiss his white nose as he drooped it into her little arms.&nbsp;
Her visits to the stable had been discovered and forbidden, but the
scandal was even greater when she was found in the paddock, standing
on an inverted bucket, and grooming the white horse with Lady Louisa&rsquo;s
tortoise-shell dressing-comb.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let me have the currycomb,&rdquo; said Amabel,
who was very hot, and perfectly self-satisfied.&nbsp; Lady Louisa was
in despair, but the Squire laughed.&nbsp; The ladies of his family had
been great horsewomen for generations.<br>
<br>
In the early summer, some light carting being required by the gardener,
he begged leave to employ &ldquo;Miss Amabel&rsquo;s old horse,&rdquo;
who came at last to trot soberly to the town with a light cart for parcels,
when the landlord of the Crown would point him out in proof of the Squire&rsquo;s
sagacity in horse-flesh.<br>
<br>
But it was not by her attachment to the cart-horse alone that Amabel
disturbed the composure of the head-nurse and of Louise the <i>bonne</i>.&nbsp;
She was a very Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp for wandering.&nbsp; She grew
rapidly, and the stronger she grew the more of a Tom-boy she became.&nbsp;
Beyond the paddock lay another field, whose farthest wall was the boundary
of a little wood, - the wood where Jan had herded pigs.&nbsp; Into this
wood it had long been Amabel&rsquo;s desire to go.&nbsp; But nurses
have a preference for the high road, and object to climbing walls, and
she had not had her wish.&nbsp; She had often peeped through a hole
in the wall, and had smelt honeysuckle.&nbsp; Once she had climbed half
way up, and had fallen on her back in the ditch.&nbsp; Louise uttered
a thousand and one exclamations when Amabel came home after this catastrophe;
and Nurse, distrusting the success of any real penalties in her power,
fell back upon imaginary ones.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a mercy you have got back, Miss Amabel,&rdquo;
said she; &ldquo;for Bogy lives in that wood; and, if you&rsquo;d got
in, it&rsquo;s ten to one he&rsquo;d have carried you off.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You <i>said</i> Bogy lived in the cellar,&rdquo; said Amabel.<br>
<br>
Nurse was in a dilemma which deservedly besets people who tell untruths.&nbsp;
She had to invent a second one to help out her first.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s at night,&rdquo; said she: &ldquo;he lives in the
wood in the daytime.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Then I can go into the cellar in the day, and the wood at night,&rdquo;
retorted Amabel; but in her heart she knew the latter was impossible.<br>
<br>
For some days Nurse&rsquo;s fable availed.&nbsp; Amabel had suffered
a good deal from Bogy; and, though the fear of him did not seem so terrible
by daylight, she had no wish to meet him.&nbsp; But one lovely afternoon,
wandering round the field for cowslips, Amabel came to the wall, and
could not but peep over to see if there were any flowers to be seen.&nbsp;
She was too short to do this without climbing, and it ended in her struggling
successfully to the top.&nbsp; There were violets on the other side,
and Amabel let down one big foot to a convenient hole, whence she hoped
to be able to stoop and catch at the violets without actually treading
in Bogy&rsquo;s domain.&nbsp; But once more she slipped and rolled over,
- this time into the wood.&nbsp; Bogy lingered, and she got on to her
feet; but the wall was deeper on this side than the other, and she saw
with dismay that it was very doubtful if she could get back.<br>
<br>
I think, as a rule, children are very brave.&nbsp; But a light heart
goes a long way towards courage.&nbsp; At first Amabel made desperate
and knee-grazing efforts to reclimb the wall, and, failing, burst into
tears, and danced, and called aloud on all her protectors, from the
Squire to Miles.&nbsp; No one coming, she restrained her tears, and
by a real effort of that &ldquo;pluck&rdquo; for which the Ammaby race
is famous began to run along the wall to find a lower point for climbing.&nbsp;
In doing so, she startled a squirrel, and whizz! - away he went up a
lanky tree.&nbsp; What a tail he had!&nbsp; Amabel forgot her terrors.&nbsp;
There was at any rate some living thing in the wood besides Bogy; and
she was now busy trying to coax the squirrel down again by such encouraging
noises as she had found successful in winning the confidence of kittens
and puppies.&nbsp; Amabel was the victim of that weakness for falling
in love with every fussy, intelligent, or pitiable beast she met with,
which besets some otherwise reasonable beings, leading to an inconvenient
accumulation of pets in private life, though doubtless invaluable in
the public services of people connected with the Zo&ouml;logical Gardens.<br>
<br>
The squirrel sat under the shadow of his own tail, and winked.&nbsp;
He had not the remotest intention of coming down.&nbsp; Amabel was calmer
now, and she looked about her.&nbsp; The eglantine bushes were shoulder-high,
but she had breasted underwood in the shrubberies, and was not afraid.&nbsp;
Up, up, stretched the trees to where the sky shone blue.&nbsp; The wood
itself sloped downwards; the spotted arums pushed boldly through last
year&rsquo;s leaves, which almost hid the violets; there were tufts
of primroses, which made Amabel cry out, and about them lay the exquisite
mauve dog-violets in unplucked profusion.&nbsp; And hither and thither
darted the little birds; red-breasts and sparrows, and yellow finches
and blue finches, and blackbirds and thrushes, with their cheerful voices
and soft waistcoats, and, indeed, every good quality but that of knowing
how glad one would be to kiss them.&nbsp; In a few steps, Amabel came
upon a path going zig-zag down the steep of the wood, and, nodding her
hooded head determinedly, she said, &ldquo;Amabel is going a walk.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t mind Bogy,&rdquo; and followed her nose.<br>
<br>
It is a pity that one&rsquo;s skirt, when held up, does not divide itself
into compartments, like some vegetable dishes.&nbsp; One is so apt to
get flowers first, and then lumps of moss, which spoil the flowers,
and then more moss, which, earth downwards (as bread and butter falls),
does no good to the rest.&nbsp; Amabel had on a nice, new dress, and
it held things beautifully.&nbsp; But it did not hold enough, for at
each step of the zig-zag path the moss grew lovelier.&nbsp; She had
got some extinguisher-moss from the top of the wall, and this now lay
under all the rest, which flattened the extinguishers.&nbsp; About half
way down the dress was full, and some cushion-moss appeared that could
not be passed by.&nbsp; Amabel sat down and reviewed her treasures.&nbsp;
She could part with nothing, and she had just caught sight of some cup-moss
lichen for dolls&rsquo; wine-glasses.&nbsp; But, by good luck, she was
provided with a white sun-bonnet, as clean and whole as her dress; and
this she took off and filled.&nbsp; It was less fortunate that the scale-mosses
and liverworts, growing nearer to the stream, came last, and, with the
damp earth about them, lay a-top of every thing, flowers, dolls&rsquo;
wine-glasses, and all.&nbsp; It was a noble collection - but heavy.&nbsp;
Amabel&rsquo;s face flushed, and she was slightly overbalanced, but
she staggered sturdily along the path, which was now level.<br>
<br>
She had quite forgotten Nurse&rsquo;s warning, when she came suddenly
upon a figure crouched in her path, and gazing at her with large, black
eyes.&nbsp; Her fat cheeks turned pale, and with a cry of, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Bogy!&rdquo; she let down the whole contents of her dress into one of
Jan&rsquo;s leaf-pictures.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt me!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t take me away!&nbsp; Please,
please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried, dancing wildly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt you, Miss.&nbsp; I be going to help you to
pick &rsquo;em up,&rdquo; said Jan.&nbsp; By the time he had returned
her treasures to her skirt, Amabel had regained confidence, especially
as she saw no signs of the black bag in which naughty children are supposed
to be put.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What are you doing, Bogy?&rdquo; said she.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I be making a picture, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan, pointing it out.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Go on making it, please,&rdquo; said Amabel; and she sat down
and watched him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you like this wood, Bogy?&rdquo; she asked, softly, after
a time.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I do, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sleep in it, then?&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t
sleep in a cellar, if I were you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sleep in a cellar, Miss.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nurse <i>says</i> you do,&rdquo; said Amabel, nodding emphatically.<br>
<br>
Jan was at a loss how to express the full inaccuracy of Nurse&rsquo;s
statement in polite language, so he was silent; rapidly adding tint
to tint from his heap of leaves, whilst the birds sang overhead, and
Amabel sat with her two bundles watching him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I thought you were an old man!&rdquo; she said, at length.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, no, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan, laughing.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look very bad,&rdquo; Amabel continued.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I be very bad,&rdquo; said Jan, modestly.<br>
<br>
Amabel&rsquo;s next questions came at short intervals, like dropping
shots.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you say your prayers, Bogy?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, Miss.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you go to church, Bogy?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, Miss.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Then where do you sit?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;In the choir, Miss; the end next to Squire Ammaby&rsquo;s big
pew.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>Do you?</i>&rdquo; said Amabel.&nbsp; She had been threatened
with Bogy for misbehavior in church, and it was startling to find that
he sat so near.&nbsp; She changed the subject, under a hasty remembrance
of having once made a face at the parson through a hole in the bombazine
curtains.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you paint with paints, Bogy?&rdquo; said she.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got none, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a paint-box,&rdquo; said Amabel.&nbsp; &ldquo;And,
if you like, I&rsquo;ll give it to you, Bogy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The color rushed to Jan&rsquo;s face.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Miss!&rdquo; he cried.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You must dip the paints in water, you know, and rub them on a
plate; and don&rsquo;t let them lie in a puddle,&rdquo; said Amabel,
who loved to dictate.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thank you, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t put your brush in your mouth,&rdquo; said Amabel.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, dear, no, Miss,&rdquo; said Jan.&nbsp; It had never struck
him that one could want to put a paint-brush in one&rsquo;s mouth.<br>
<br>
At this point Amabel&rsquo;s overwrought energies suddenly failed her,
and she burst out crying.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I shall
get over the wall,&rdquo; said she.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee cry, Miss.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo;
said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t walk any more,&rdquo; sobbed Amabel, who was, indeed,
tired out.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;ee on my back,&rdquo; said Jan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee cry.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
With a good deal of difficulty, Amabel was hoisted up, and planted her
big feet in Jan&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; It was no light pilgrimage for
poor Jan, as he climbed the winding path.&nbsp; Amabel was peevish with
weariness; her bundles were sadly in the way, and at every step a cup-moss
or <i>marchantia</i> dropped out, and Amabel insisted upon its being
picked up.&nbsp; But they reached the wall at last, and Jan got her
over, and made two or three expeditions after the missing mosses, before
the little lady was finally content.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Good-by, Bogy,&rdquo; she said, at last, holding up her face
to be kissed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And thank you very much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not frightened of you, Bogy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As Jan kissed her, he said, smiling, &ldquo;What is your name, love?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And she said, &ldquo;Amabel.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
To her parents and guardians, Amabel made the following statement: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen Bogy.&nbsp; I like him.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t sleep in the cellar,
so Nurse told a story.&nbsp; And he didn&rsquo;t take me away, so that&rsquo;s
another story.&nbsp; He says his prayers, and he goes to church, so
he can&rsquo;t be the Bad Man.&nbsp; He makes pictures with leaves.&nbsp;
He carried me on his back, but not in a bag&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
At this point the outraged feelings of Lady Craikshaw exploded, and
she rang the bell, and ordered Miss Amabel to be put to bed with a dose
of rhubarb and magnesia (without sal-volatile), for telling stories.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The eau-de-Cologne, mamma dear, please,&rdquo; said Lady Louisa,
as the door closed on the struggling, screaming, and protesting Amabel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it really dreadful?&nbsp; But Esmerelda Ammaby says
Henry used to tell shocking stories when he was a little boy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXIV.<br>
<br>
THE PAINT-BOX. - MASTER LINSEED&rsquo;S SHOP. - THE NEW SIGN-BOARD.
- MASTER SWIFT AS WILL SCARLET.<br>
<br>
On Sunday morning Jan took his place in church with unusual feelings.&nbsp;
He looked here, there, and everywhere for the little damsel of the wood,
but she was not to be seen.&nbsp; Meanwhile she had not sent the paint
box, and he feared it would never come.&nbsp; He fancied she must be
the Squire&rsquo;s little daughter, but he was not sure, and she certainly
was not in the big pew, where the back of the Squire&rsquo;s red head
and Lady Louisa&rsquo;s aquiline nose were alone visible.&nbsp; She
was a dear little soul, he thought.&nbsp; He wondered why she called
him Bogy.&nbsp; Perhaps it was a way little ladies had of addressing
their inferiors.<br>
<br>
Jan did not happen to guess that, Amabel being very young, the morning
services were too long for her.&nbsp; In the afternoon he had given
her up, but she was there.<br>
<br>
The old Rector had reached the third division of his sermon, and Lady
Craikshaw was asleep, when Amabel, mounting the seat with her usual
vigor, pushed her Sunday hood through the bombazine curtains, and said,
-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Bogy!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan looked up, and then started to his feet as Amabel stuffed the paint-box
into his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;I pushed it under my frock,&rdquo; she
said in a stage whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;It made me so tight?&nbsp; But
grandmamma is such&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
Jan heard and saw no more.&nbsp; Amabel&rsquo;s footing was apt to be
insecure; she slipped upon the cushions and disappeared with a crash.<br>
<br>
Jan trembled as he clasped the shallow old cedar-wood box.&nbsp; He
wondered if the colors would prove as bright as those in the window.&nbsp;
He fancied the wan, ascetic faces there rejoiced with him.&nbsp; When
he got home, he sat under the shadow of the mill, and drew back the
sliding lid of the box.&nbsp; Brushes, and twelve hard color cakes.&nbsp;
They were Ackermann&rsquo;s, and very good.&nbsp; Cheap paint-boxes
were not made then.&nbsp; He read the names on the back of them: Neutral
Tint, Prussian Blue, Indian Red, Yellow Ochre, Brown Madder, Brown Pink,
Burnt Umber, Vandyke Brown, Indigo, King&rsquo;s Yellow, Rose Madder,
and Ivory Black.<br>
<br>
It says much for Jan&rsquo;s uprightness of spirit, and for the sense
of duty in which the schoolmaster was training him, that he did not
neglect school for his new treasure.&nbsp; Happily for him the sun rose
early, and Jan rose with it, and taking his paint-box to the little
wood, on scraps of parcel paper and cap paper, on bits of wood and smooth
white stones, he blotted-in studies of color, which he finished from
memory at odd moments in the windmill.<br>
<br>
In the summer holidays, Jan had more time for sketching.&nbsp; But the
many occasions on which he could not take his paints with him led him
to observe closely, and taught him to paint from memory with wonderful
exactness.&nbsp; He was also obliged to reduce his outlines and condense
his effects to a very small scale to economize paper.<br>
<br>
About this time he heard that Master Chuter was going to have a new
sign painted for the inn.&nbsp; Master Linseed was to paint it.<br>
<br>
Master Linseed&rsquo;s shop had been a place of resort for Jan in some
of his leisure time.&nbsp; At first the painter and decorator had been
churlish enough to him, but, finding that Jan was skilful with a brush,
he employed him again and again to do his work, for which he received
instead of giving thanks.&nbsp; Jan went there less after he got a paint-box,
and could produce effects with good materials of his own, instead of
making imperfect experiments in color on bits of wood in the painter&rsquo;s
shop.<br>
<br>
But in this matter of the new sign-board he took the deepest interest.&nbsp;
He had a design of his own for it, which he was most anxious the painter
should adopt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee, Master Linseed,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It be the Heart of Oak.&nbsp; Now I know a oak-tree
with a big trunk and two arms.&nbsp; They stretches out one on each
side, and the little branches closes in above till &rsquo;tis just like
a heart.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be beautiful, Master Linseed, and I could
bring &rsquo;ee leaves of the oak so that &rsquo;ee could match the
yellows and greens.&nbsp; And then there&rsquo;d be trees beyond and
beyond, smaller and smaller, and all like a blue mist between them,
thee know.&nbsp; That blue in the paper &rsquo;ee&rsquo;ve got would
just do, and with more white to it &rsquo;twould be beautiful for the
sky.&nbsp; And&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s to do all that for a few shillings?&rdquo; broke
in the painter, testily.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Master Chuter wants it done
and hung up for the Foresters&rsquo; dinner.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Since the pressing nature of the commission was Master Linseed&rsquo;s
excuse for not adopting his idea for the sign, it seemed strange to
Jan that he did not set about it in some fashion.&nbsp; But he delayed
and delayed, till Master Chuter was goaded to repeat the old rumor that
real sign-painting was beyond his powers.<br>
<br>
It was within a week of the dinner that the little innkeeper burst indignantly
into the painter&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; Master Linseed was ill in bed,
and the sign-board lay untouched in a corner.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It be a kind of fever that&rsquo;s on him,&rdquo; said his wife.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It be a kind of fiddlestick!&rdquo; said the enraged Master Chuter;
and turning round his eye fell on Jan, who was looking as disconsolate
as himself.&nbsp; Day after day had he come in hopes of seeing Master
Linseed at work, and now it seemed indefinitely postponed.&nbsp; But
the innkeeper&rsquo;s face brightened, and, seizing Jan by the shoulder,
he dragged him from the shop.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ee here, Jan Lake,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
&rsquo;ee thenk <i>thee</i> could paint the sign?&nbsp; I dunno what
I&rsquo;d give &rsquo;ee if &rsquo;ee could, if &rsquo;twere only to
spite that humbugging old hudmedud yonder.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan felt as if his brain were on fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;If &rsquo;ee&rsquo;ll
get me the things, Master Chuter,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;and&rsquo;ll
let me paint it in your place, I&rsquo;ll do it for &rsquo;ee for nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The innkeeper was not insensible to this consideration, but his chief
wish was to spite Master Linseed.&nbsp; He lost no time in making ready,
and for the rest of the week Jan lived between the tallet (or hay-loft)
of the inn and the wood where he had first studied trees.&nbsp; Master
Chuter provided him with sheets of thick whitey-brown paper, on which
he made water-color studies, from which he painted afterwards.&nbsp;
By his desire no one was admitted to the tallet, though Master Chuter&rsquo;s
delight increased with the progress of the picture till the secret was
agony to him.&nbsp; Towards the end of the week they were disturbed
by a scuffling on the tallet stairs, and Rufus bounced in, followed
at a slower pace by the schoolmaster, crying, &ldquo;Unearthed at last!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Come in, come in!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; shouted Master
Chuter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let Master Swift look, Jan.&nbsp; He be a scholar,
and&rsquo;ll tell us all about un.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But Jan shrank into the shadow.&nbsp; The schoolmaster stood in the
light of the open shutter, towards which the painting was sloped, and
Rufus sat by him on his haunches, and blinked with all the gravity of
a critic; and in the half light between them and the stairs stood the
fat little innkeeper, with his hands on his knees, crying, &ldquo;There,
Master Swift!&nbsp; Did &rsquo;ee ever see any thing to beat that?&nbsp;
Artis&rsquo; or ammytoor!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan&rsquo;s very blood seemed to stand still.&nbsp; As Master Swift
put on his spectacles, each fault in the painting sprang to the front
and mocked him.&nbsp; It was indeed a wretched daub!<br>
<br>
But Jan had been studying the scene under every lovely light of heaven
from dawn to dusk for a week of summer days: Master Swift carried no
such severe test in his brain.&nbsp; As he raised his head, the tears
were in his eyes, and he held out his hand, saying, &ldquo;My lad, it&rsquo;s
just the spirit of the woods.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But d&rsquo;ye not think a figure or so would enliven it?&rdquo;
he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of Robin Hood&rsquo;s foresters &rsquo;chasing
the flying roe&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>Foresters!</i>&nbsp; To be sure!&rdquo; said Master Chuter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What did I say?&nbsp; Have the schoolmaster in, says I.&nbsp;
He be a scholar, and knows what&rsquo;s what.&nbsp; Put &rsquo;em in,
Jan, put &rsquo;em in! there&rsquo;s plenty of room.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
What Jan had already suffered from the innkeeper&rsquo;s suggestions,
only an artist can imagine, and his imagination will need no help!<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be main glad to get a bit of red in there,&rdquo; said
Jan, in a low voice, to Master Swift; &ldquo;but Robin Hood must be
in green, sir, mustn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Will Scarlet.&nbsp; Put Will in,&rdquo; said Master
Swift, who, pleased to be appealed to, threw himself warmly into the
matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;He can have just drawn his bow at a deer out of
sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with a charming simplicity the old schoolmaster
flung his burly figure into an appropriate attitude.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stand so a minute!&rdquo; cried Jan, and seizing a lump of charcoal,
with which he had made his outlines, he rapidly sketched Master Swift&rsquo;s
figure on the floor of the tallet.&nbsp; Thinned down to what he declared
to have been his dimensions in youth, it was transferred to Jan&rsquo;s
picture, and the touch of red was the culminating point of the innkeeper&rsquo;s
satisfaction.<br>
<br>
On the day of the dinner the new sign swung aloft.&nbsp; &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t
dry better anywhere,&rdquo; said Master Chuter.<br>
<br>
Jan &ldquo;found himself famous.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole parish assembled
to admire.&nbsp; The windmiller, in his amazement, could not even find
a proverb for the occasion, whilst Abel hung about the door of the Heart
of Oak, as if he had been the most confirmed toper, saying to all incomers,
&ldquo;Have &rsquo;ee seen the new sign, sir?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas our
Jan did un.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
His fame would probably have spread more widely, but for a more overwhelming
interest which came to distract the neighborhood, and which destroyed
a neat little project of Master Chuter&rsquo;s for running up a few
tables amongst his kidney-beans, as a kind of &ldquo;tea garden&rdquo;
for folk from outlying villages, who, coming in on Sunday afternoons
to service, should also want to see the work of the boy sign-painter.<br>
<br>
It is a curious instance of the inaccuracy of popular impressions that,
when Master Linseed died three days after the Foresters&rsquo; dinner,
it was universally believed that he had been killed by vexation at Jan&rsquo;s
success.&nbsp; Nor was this tradition the less firmly fixed in the village
annals, that the disease to which he had succumbed spread like flames
in a gale.&nbsp; It produced a slight reaction of sentiment against
Jan.&nbsp; And his achievement was absolutely forgotten in the shadow
of the months that followed.<br>
<br>
For it was that year long known in the history of the district as the
year of the Black Fever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXV.<br>
<br>
SANITARY INSPECTORS. - THE PESTILENCE. - THE PARSON. - THE DOCTOR. -
THE SQUIRE AND THE SCHOOLMASTER. - DESOLATION AT THE WINDMILL. - THE
SECOND ADVENT.<br>
<br>
I remember a &ldquo;cholera year&rdquo; in a certain big village.&nbsp;
The activity of the sanitary authorities (and many and vain had been
the efforts to rouse them to activity <i>before</i>) was, for them,
remarkable.&nbsp; A good many heads of households died with fearful
suddenness and not less fearful suffering.&nbsp; Several nuisances were
&ldquo;seen to,&rdquo; some tar-barrels were burnt, and the scourge
passed by.&nbsp; Not long ago a woman, whose home is in a court where
some of the most flagrant nuisances existed, in talking to me, casually
alluded to one of them.&nbsp; It had been ordered to be removed, she
said, in the cholera year when the gentlemen were going round; but the
cholera went away, and it remained among those things which were <i>not</i>
&ldquo;seen to,&rdquo; and for aught I know flourishes still.&nbsp;
She was a sensible and affectionate person.&nbsp; Living away from her
home at that time, she became anxious at once for the welfare of her
relatives if they neglected to write to her.&nbsp; But she had never
an anxiety on the subject of that unremedied abomination which was poisoning
every breath they drew.&nbsp; That &ldquo;the gentlemen who went round&rdquo;
felt it superfluous to have their orders carried out when strong men
were no longer sickening and dying within two revolutions of the hands
of the church clock will surprise no one who has had to do with local
sanitary officers.&nbsp; They are like the children of Israel, and will
only do their duty under the pressure of a plague.&nbsp; The people
themselves are more like the Egyptians.&nbsp; Plagues won&rsquo;t convince
them.&nbsp; A mother with all her own and her neighbors&rsquo; children
sickening about her would walk miles in a burst shoe to fetch the doctor
or a big bottle of medicine, but she won&rsquo;t walk three yards farther
than usual to draw her house-water from the well that the sewer doesn&rsquo;t
leak into.&nbsp; That is a fact, not a fable; and, in the cases I am
thinking of, all medical remonstrance was vain.&nbsp; Uneducated people
will take any thing in from the doctor through their mouths, but little
or nothing through their ears.<br>
<br>
When such is the state of matters in busy, stirring districts, among
shrewd artisans, and when our great seat of learning smells as it does
smell under the noses of the professors, it is needless to say that
the &ldquo;black fever&rdquo; found every household in the little village
prepared to contribute to its support, and met with hardly an obstacle
on its devastating path.<br>
<br>
To comment on Master Salter&rsquo;s qualifications for the post of sanitary
inspector would be to insult the reader&rsquo;s understanding.&nbsp;
Of course he owned several of the picturesque little cottages where
the refuse had to be pitched out at the back, and the slops chucked
out in front, and where the general arrangements for health, comfort,
and decency were such as one must forbear to speak of, since, on such
matters, our ears - Heaven help us! - have all that delicacy which seems
denied to our noses.<br>
<br>
If the causes of the calamity were little understood, portents were
plentifully noted.&nbsp; The previous winter had been mild.&nbsp; A
thunderbolt fell in the autumn.&nbsp; There was a blight on the gooseberries,
and Master Salter had a calf with two heads.&nbsp; As to the painter,
a screech-owl had been heard to cry from his chimney-top, not three
weeks before his death.<br>
<br>
There was a pause of a day or so after Master Linseed died, and then
victims fell thick and fast.&nbsp; Children playing happily with their
mimic boats on the open drain that ran lazily under the noontide sun,
by the footpath of the main street, were coffined for their hasty burial
before the sun had next reached his meridian.&nbsp; The tears were hardly
dry in their parents&rsquo; eyes before these also were closed in their
last sleep.&nbsp; The very aged seemed to linger on, but strong men
sickened and died; and at the end of the week more than one woman was
left sitting by an empty hearth, a worn-out creature whom Death seemed
only to have forgotten to take away.<br>
<br>
At first there was a reckless disregard of infection among the neighbors.&nbsp;
But, after one or two of these family desolations, this was succeeded
by a panic, and even the noble charity which the poor commonly show
to each other&rsquo;s troubles failed, and no one could be got to nurse
the sick or bury the dead.<br>
<br>
Now the Rector was an old man.&nbsp; Most of the parish officers were
aged, and patriarchs in white smock frocks were as plentiful as creepers
at the cottage doors.&nbsp; The healthy breezes and the dull pace at
which life passed in the district seemed to make men slow to wear out.&nbsp;
If the Rector had profited by these features of the parish in health,
it must be confessed that they had also had their influence on his career.&nbsp;
He was a good man, and a learned one.&nbsp; He stuck close to his living,
and he was benevolent.&nbsp; But he was not of those heroic natures
who can resist the influence of the mental atmosphere around them; and
in a dull parish, in a sleepy age, he had not been an active parson.&nbsp;
Some men, however, who cannot make opportunities for themselves, can
do nobly enough if the chance comes to them; and this chance came to
the Rector in his sixty-ninth year, on the wings of the black fever.&nbsp;
To quicken spiritual life in the soul of a Master Salter he had not
the courage even to attempt; but a panic of physical cowardice had not
a temptation for him.&nbsp; And so it came about that of four men who
stayed the panic, by the example of their own courage, who went from
house to house, and from sick-bed to sick-bed - who drew a cordon round
the parish, and established kitchens and a temporary hospital, and nursed
the sick, and encouraged the living, and buried the dead, - the most
active was the old Rector.<br>
<br>
The other three were the parish doctor, Squire Ammaby, and the schoolmaster.<br>
<br>
On the very first rumor of the epidemic, Lady Louisa had carried off
Amabel, and had gone with Lady Craikshaw to Brighton.&nbsp; Both the
ladies were indignant with the Squire&rsquo;s obstinate resolve to remain
amongst his tenants.&nbsp; In her alarm, Lady Louisa implored him to
sell the property and buy one in Ireland, which was Lady Craikshaw&rsquo;s
native country; and the list she contrived to run up of the drawbacks
to the Ammaby estate would have driven a temper less stolid than her
husband&rsquo;s to distraction.<br>
<br>
When the fever broke out among the children, the schools were closed,
and Master Swift devoted his whole time to laboring with the parson,
the doctor, and the Squire.<br>
<br>
No part of the Rector&rsquo;s devotion won more affectionate gratitude
from his people than a single act of thoughtfulness, by which he preserved
a record of the graves of their dead.&nbsp; He had held firmly on to
a decent and reverent burial, and, foreseeing that the poor survivors
would be quite unable to afford gravestones, he kept a strict list of
the dead, and where they were buried, which was afterwards transferred
to one large monument, which was bought by subscription.&nbsp; He cut
the village off from all communication with the outer world, to prevent
a spread of the disease; but he sent accounts of the calamity to the
public papers, which brought abundant help in money for the needs of
the parish.&nbsp; And in these matters the schoolmaster was his right-hand
man.<br>
<br>
The disease was most eccentric in its path.&nbsp; Having scourged one
side only of the main street, it burst out with virulence in detached
houses at a distance.&nbsp; Then it returned to the village, and after
lulls and outbreaks it ceased as suddenly as it began.<br>
<br>
It was about midway in its career that it fell with all its wrath upon
Master Lake&rsquo;s windmill.<br>
<br>
The mill stood in a healthy position, but the dwelling room was ill-ventilated,
and there were defective sanitary arrangements, which Master Swift had
anxiously pointed out to the miller.&nbsp; The plague had begun in the
village, and the schoolmaster trembled for Jan.&nbsp; But Master Lake
was not to be interfered with, and, when the schoolmaster spoke of poison,
thought himself witty as he replied, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It be a uncommon slow pison then, Master Swift.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It must also be allowed that such epidemics, once started, do havoc
in apparently clean houses and amongst well-fed people.<br>
<br>
It was a little foster-sister of Jan&rsquo;s who sickened first.&nbsp;
She died within two days.&nbsp; Her burial was hasty enough, but Mrs.
Lake had no time to fret about that, for a second child was ill.&nbsp;
Like many another householder, the poor windmiller was now ready enough
to look to his drains, and so forth; but it may be doubted if the general
stirring up of dirty places at this moment did not do as much harm as
good.&nbsp; It was hot, - terribly hot.&nbsp; Day after day passed without
a breeze to cool the burning skins of the sick, and yet it was not sunshiny.&nbsp;
People did say that the pestilence hung like a murky vapor above the
district, and hid the sun.<br>
<br>
Trades were slack, corn-grinding amongst the rest, and Master Lake did
the housework, helped by Jan and Abel.&nbsp; He was stunned by the suddenness
and the weight of the calamity which had come to him.&nbsp; He was very
kind to Mrs. Lake, but the poor woman was almost past any feeling but
that which, as a sort of instinct or inspiration, guided a constant
watching and waiting on her sick children.&nbsp; She never slept, and
would not have eaten, but that Master Lake used his authority to force
some food upon her.&nbsp; At this time Jan&rsquo;s chief occupations
were cookery and dish-washing.&nbsp; His constant habit of observation
made all the experiences of life an education for him; he had often
watched his foster-mother prepare the family meals, and he prepared
them now, for Abel and the windmiller could not, and she was with the
sick children.<br>
<br>
Before the second child died, two more fell ill on the same day.&nbsp;
Only Abel and Jan were still &ldquo;about.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mother moved
like an automaton, and never spoke.&nbsp; Now and then a deep sigh or
a low moan would escape her, and the miller would move tenderly to her
side, and say, &ldquo;Bear up, missus; bear up, my lass,&rdquo; and
then go back to his pipe and his cherry-wood chair, where he seemed
to grow gray as he sat.<br>
<br>
Master Swift came from time to time to the mill.&nbsp; He was everywhere,
helping, comforting, and exhorting.&nbsp; Some said his face shone with
the light of another world, for which he was &ldquo;marked.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Others whispered that the strain was telling on him, and that it wore
the look it had had in the brief insanity which followed his child&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; But all agreed that the very sight of him brought help
and consolation.&nbsp; The windmiller grew to watch for him, and to
lean on him in the helplessness of his despair.&nbsp; And he listened
humbly to the old man&rsquo;s fervid religious counsels.&nbsp; His own
little threads of philosophy were all blowing loose and useless in this
storm of trouble.<br>
<br>
The evening that Master Swift came up to arrange about the burial of
the second child, he found the other two just dead.&nbsp; The first
two had suffered much and been delirious, but these two had sunk painlessly
in a few hours, and had fallen asleep for the last time in each other&rsquo;s
arms.<br>
<br>
It did not lessen the force of Master Swift&rsquo;s somewhat stern consolations
that in all good faith he conveyed in them an expectation that the Last
Day was at hand.&nbsp; Many people thought so, and it was, perhaps,
not unnatural.&nbsp; In these days, which were long years of suffering,
they were shut off from the rest of humanity, and the village was the
world to them, - a world very near its end.&nbsp; With Death so busy,
it seemed as if Judgment could hardly linger long.<br>
<br>
It is true that this did not form a part of the Rector&rsquo;s religious
exhortations.&nbsp; But some good people were shocked by the tea-party
that he gave to the young people of the place, and the games that followed
it in the Rectory meads, at the very height of the fever; though the
doctor said it was better than a hogshead of medicine.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To encourage low spirits in this panic is just to promote suicide,
if ye like the responsibeelity of that,&rdquo; said the doctor to Master
Swift, who had confided his doubts as to the seemliness of the entertainment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I tell ye there&rsquo;s a lairge proportion of folk dies just
because their neighbors have died before them, for the want of their
attention being directed to something else.&nbsp; Away wi&rsquo; ye,
schoolmaster, and take your tuning-fork to ask the blessing wi&rsquo;.&nbsp;
What says the Scripture, man?&nbsp; &rsquo;The living, the living, he
shall praise Thee!&rsquo;&ldquo;<br>
<br>
The doctor was a Scotchman, and Master Swift always listened with sympathy
to a North countryman.&nbsp; He was convinced, too, and took his tuning-fork
to the meals, and led the grace.<br>
<br>
Nor could his expectation of the speedy end of all things restrain his
instinctive anxiety and watchfulness for Jan&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; On
the evening of that visit to the mill, he used some little manoeuvring
to accomplish Jan&rsquo;s being sent back with him to the village, to
arrange for the burial of the three children.<br>
<br>
A glow of satisfaction suffused his rough face as he got Jan out of
the tainted house into the fresh evening air, though it paled again
before that other look which was now habitual to him, as, waving his
hand towards the ripening corn-fields, he quoted from one of Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s
loftiest hymns, -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We talk of harvests, - there are
no such things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we leave our
corn and hay.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no fruitful year but that
which brings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last and loved,
though dreadful Day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,
show Thyself to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
take me up to Thee!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXVI.<br>
<br>
THE BEASTS OF THE VILLAGE. - ABEL SICKENS. - THE GOOD SHEPHERD. - RUFUS
PLAYS THE PHILANTHROPIST. - MASTER SWIFT SEES THE SUN RISE. - THE DEATH
OF THE RIGHTEOUS.<br>
<br>
Amid the havoc made by the fever amongst men, women, and children, the
immunity of the beasts and birds had a sad strangeness.<br>
<br>
There was a small herd of pigs which changed hands three times in ten
days.&nbsp; The last purchaser hesitated, and was only induced by the
cheapness of the bargain to suppress a feeling that they brought ill-luck.&nbsp;
Cats mewed wistfully about desolated hearths.&nbsp; One dog moaned near
the big grave in which his master lay, and others, with sad sagacious
eyes, went to look for new friends and homes.<br>
<br>
It was a day or two after the burial of the miller&rsquo;s three children,
that, as Jan sat at dinner with Abel and his two parents, he was struck
by the way in which the mill cats hung about Abel, purring and rubbing
themselves against his legs.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I do think they misses the others,&rdquo; he whispered to his
foster-brother, and his tears fell thick and fast on to his plate.<br>
<br>
Abel made no answer.&nbsp; He did not wish Jan to know that he had given
all his food by bits to the cats, because he could not swallow it himself.&nbsp;
But, later in the day, Jan found him in the round-house, lying on an
empty sack, with his head against a full one.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee tell mother,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
I do feel bad.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And as Jan sat down, and put his arms about him, on the very spot where
they had so often sat together, learning the alphabet and educating
their thumbs, Abel laid his head on his foster-brother&rsquo;s shoulder,
saying, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I do think, Janny dear, that Mary, she wants me, and the others
too.&nbsp; I think I be going after them.&nbsp; But thee&rsquo;ll look
to mother, Janny dear, eh?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But <i>I</i> want thee, too, Abel dear,&rdquo; sobbed Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I be thinking perhaps them that brought thee hither&rsquo;ll
fetch thee away some day, Jan.&nbsp; But thee&rsquo;ll see to mother?&rdquo;
repeated Abel, his eyes wandering restlessly with a look of pain.<br>
<br>
Jan knew now that he was only an adopted child of the windmill, though
he stoutly ignored the fact, being very fond of his foster-parents.<br>
<br>
Abel&rsquo;s illness came with the force of a fresh blow.&nbsp; There
had been a slight pause in the course of the fever at the mill, and
it seemed as if these two boys were to be spared.&nbsp; Abel had been
busy helping his father to burn the infected bedding, etc., that very
morning, and at night he lay raving.<br>
<br>
He raved of Jan&rsquo;s picture which swung unheeded above Master Chuter&rsquo;s
door, and confused it with some church-window that he seemed to fancy
Jan had painted; then of his dead brothers and sisters.&nbsp; And then
from time to time he rambled about a great flock of sheep which he saw
covering the vast plains about the windmill, and which he wearied himself
in trying to count.&nbsp; And, as he tossed, he complained in piteous
tones about some man who seemed to be the shepherd, and who would not
do something that Abel wanted.<br>
<br>
For the most part, he knew no one but Jan, and then only when Jan touched
him.&nbsp; It seemed to give him pleasure.&nbsp; He understood nothing
that was said to him, except in brief intervals.&nbsp; Once, after a
short sleep, he opened his eyes and recognized the schoolmaster.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Master Swift,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do &rsquo;ee think that
be our Lord among them sheep?&nbsp; With His hair falling on&rsquo;s
shoulders, and the light round His head, and the long frock?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Master Swift&rsquo;s eyes turned involuntarily in the direction in which
Abel&rsquo;s were gazing.&nbsp; He saw nothing but the dark corners
of the dwelling-room; but he said, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, Abel, my lad.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What be His frock all red for, then?&nbsp; Bright red, like blood.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis like them figures in - in&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
Here Abel wandered again, and only muttered to himself.&nbsp; But when
Jan crept near to him, and touching him said, &ldquo;The figures in
the window, Abel dear,&rdquo; he opened his eyes and said, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So it be, Janny.&nbsp; With the sun shining through &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
Thee knows.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And then he wailed fretfully, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why do He keep His back to me all along?&nbsp; I follows Him
up and down, all over, till I be tired.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t He turn
His face?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan was speechless from tears, but the old schoolmaster took Abel&rsquo;s
hot hand in his, and said, with infinite tenderness, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He will, my lad.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll turn His face to thee very
soon.&nbsp; Wait for Him, Abel.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do &rsquo;ee think so?&rdquo; said Abel.&nbsp; And after a while
he muttered, &ldquo;You be the schoolmaster, and ought to know.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And, seemingly satisfied, he dozed once more.<br>
<br>
Master Swift hurried away.&nbsp; He had business in the village, and
he wanted to catch the doctor, and ask his opinion of Abel&rsquo;s case.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Will be get round, sir?&rdquo; he asked.<br>
<br>
The doctor shook his head, and Master Swift felt a double pang.&nbsp;
He was sorry about Abel, but the real object of his anxiety was Jan.&nbsp;
Once he had hoped the danger was past, but the pestilence seemed still
in full strength at the windmill, and the agonizing conviction strengthened
in his mind that once more his hopes were to be disappointed, and the
desire of his eyes was to be snatched away.&nbsp; The doctor thought
that he was grieving for Abel, and said, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as sorry as yourself.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a fine
lad, with something angelic about the face, when ye separate it from
its surroundings.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;ve no constitution in that family.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s just the want of strength in him, and not the strength of
the fever, this time; for the virulence of the poison&rsquo;s abating.&nbsp;
The cases are recovering now, except where other causes intervene.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Master Swift felt almost ashamed of the bound in his spirits.&nbsp;
But the very words which shut out all hope of Abel&rsquo;s recovery
opened a possible door of escape for Jan.&nbsp; He was not one of the
family, and it was reasonable to hope that his constitution might be
of sterner stuff.&nbsp; He turned with a lighter heart into his cottage,
where he purposed to get some food and then return to the mill.&nbsp;
There might be a lucid interval before the end, in which the pious Abel
might find comfort from his lips; and if Jan sickened, he would nurse
him night and day.<br>
<br>
Rufus welcomed his master not merely with cordiality, but with fussiness.&nbsp;
The partly apologetic character of his greeting was accounted for when
a half starved looking dog emerged from beneath the table, and, not
being immediately kicked, wagged the point of its tail feebly, keeping
at a respectful distance, whilst Rufus introduced it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So ye&rsquo;re for playing the philanthropist, are ye?&rdquo;
said Master Swift.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve picked up one of these poor
houseless, masterless creatures?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not for undervaluing
disinterested charity, Rufus, my man; but I wish ye&rsquo;d had the
luck to light on a better bred beast while ye were about it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It is, perhaps, no disadvantage to what we call &ldquo;dumb animals&rdquo;
if they understand the general drift of our remarks without minutely
following every word.&nbsp; They have generally the sense, too, to leave
well alone, and, without pressing the question of the new comer&rsquo;s
adoption, the two dogs curled themselves round, put their noses into
their pockets, and went to sleep with an air of its being unnecessary
to pursue the topic farther.<br>
<br>
Master Swift shared his meal with them, and left them to keep house
when he returned to the mill.<br>
<br>
His quick eye, doubly quickened by experience and by anxiety, saw that
Jan&rsquo;s were full of fever, and his limbs languid.&nbsp; But he
would not quit Abel&rsquo;s side, and Master Swift remained with the
afflicted family.<br>
<br>
Abel muttered deliriously all night, with short intervals of complete
stupor.&nbsp; The fever, like a fire, consumed his strength, and the
fancy that he was toiling over the downs seemed to weary him as if he
had really been on foot.&nbsp; Just before sunrise, Master Swift left
him asleep, and went to breathe some out-door air.<br>
<br>
The fresh, tender light of early morning was over every thing.&nbsp;
The windmill stood up against the red-barred sky with outlines softened
by the clinging dew.&nbsp; The plains glistened, and across them, through
the pure air, came the voice of Master Salter&rsquo;s chanticleer from
the distant farm.<br>
<br>
It was such a contrast to the scene within that Master Swift burst into
tears.&nbsp; But even as he wept the sun leaped to the horizon, and,
reflected from every dewdrop, and from the very tears upon the old man&rsquo;s
cheeks, flooded the world about him with its inimitable glory.<br>
<br>
The schoolmaster uncovered his head, and kneeling upon the short grass
prayed passionately for the dying boy.&nbsp; But, as he knelt in the
increasing sunshine, his prayers for the peace of the departing soul
unconsciously passed almost into thanksgiving that so soon, and so little
stained, it should exchange the dingy sick-room - not for these sweet
summer days, which lose their sweetness! - but to taste, in peace which
passeth understanding, what GOD has prepared for them that love Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
It was whilst the schoolmaster still knelt outside the windmill that
Abel awoke, and raised his eyes to Jan&rsquo;s with a smile.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thee must go out a bit soon, Janny dear,&rdquo; he whispered,
&ldquo;it be such a lovely day.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan was too much pleased to hear him speak to wonder how he knew what
kind of a day it was, and Abel lay with his head in Jan&rsquo;s arms,
breathing painfully and gazing before him.&nbsp; Suddenly he raised
himself, and cried, - so loudly that the old man outside heard the cry,
-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Janny dear!&nbsp; He&rsquo;ve turned his face to me.&nbsp; He
be coming right to me.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; He&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
But HE had come.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXVII.<br>
<br>
JAN HAS THE FEVER. - CONVALESCENCE IN MASTER SWIFT&rsquo;S COTTAGE.
- THE SQUIRE ON DEMORALIZATION.<br>
<br>
Jan took the fever.&nbsp; He was very ill, too, partly from grief at
Abel&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; He had also a not unnatural conviction that
he would die, which was unfavorable to his recovery.<br>
<br>
The day on which he gave Master Swift his old etching as a last bequest,
he fairly infected him also with this belief, and during a necessary
visit to the village the schoolmaster hung up the little picture in
his cottage with a breaking heart.<br>
<br>
But the next time Rufus saw him, he came to prepare for a visitor.&nbsp;
Jan was recovering, and Master Swift had persuaded the windmiller to
let him come to the cottage for a few days, the rather that Mrs. Lake
was going to stay with a relative whilst the windmill was thoroughly
cleansed and disinfected.&nbsp; The weather was delightful now, and,
feeble as he had become, Jan soon grew strong again.&nbsp; If he had
not done so, it would have been from no lack of care on Master Swift&rsquo;s
part.&nbsp; The old schoolmaster was a thrifty man, and had some money
laid by, or he would have been somewhat pinched at this time.&nbsp;
As it was, he drew freely upon his savings for Jan&rsquo;s benefit,
and made many expeditions to the town to buy such delicacies as he thought
might tempt his appetite.&nbsp; Nor was this all.&nbsp; The morning
when Jan came languidly into the kitchen from the little inner room,
where he and the schoolmaster slept, he saw his precious paint-box on
the table, to fetch which Master Swift had been to the windmill.&nbsp;
And by it lay a square book with the word <i>Sketch-book</i> in ornamental
characters on the binding, a couple of Cumberland lead drawing pencils,
and a three-penny chunk of bottle India-rubber, delicious to smell.<br>
<br>
If the schoolmaster had had any twinges of regret as he bought these
things, in defiance of his principles for Jan&rsquo;s education, they
melted utterly away in view of his delight, and the glow that pleasure
brought into his pale cheeks.&nbsp; Master Swift was regarded, too,
by a colored sketch of Rufus sitting at table in his arm-chair, with
his more mongrel friend on the floor beside him.&nbsp; It was the best
sketch that Jan had yet accomplished.&nbsp; But most people are familiar
with the curious fact that one often makes an unaccountable stride in
an art after it has been laid aside for a time.<br>
<br>
It must not be supposed that Master Swift had neglected his duties in
the village, or left the Parson, the Squire, and the doctor to struggle
on alone, during the illness of Abel and of Jan.&nbsp; Even now he was
away from the cottage for the greater part of the day, and Jan was left
to keep house with the dogs.&nbsp; His presence gave great contentment
to Rufus, if it scarcely lessened the melancholy dignity of his countenance;
for dogs who live with human beings never like being left long alone.&nbsp;
And Jan, for his own part, could have wished for nothing better than
to sit at the table where he had once hoped to make leaf-pictures, and
paint away with materials that Rembrandt himself would not have disdained.<br>
<br>
The pestilence had passed away.&nbsp; But the labors of the Rector and
his staff rather increased than diminished at this particular point.&nbsp;
To say nothing of those vile wretches who seem to spring out of such
calamities as putrid matter breeds vermin, and who use them as opportunities
for plunder, there were a good many people to be dealt with of a lighter
shade of demoralization, - people who had really suffered, and whose
daily work had been unavoidably stopped, but to whom idleness was so
pleasant, and the fame of their misfortunes so gratifying, that they
preferred to scramble on in dismantled homes, on the alms extracted
by their woes, to setting about such labor as would place them in comfort.&nbsp;
Then that large class - the shiftless - was now doubly large, and there
were widows and orphans in abundance, and there was hardly a bed or
a blanket in the place.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said Mr. Ammaby, joining the Rector as he
sat at breakfast, &ldquo;to beg you, in the interests of the village,
to check the flow of that fount of benevolence which springs eternal
in the clerical pocket.&nbsp; You will ruin us with your shillings and
half crowns.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Bless my soul, Ammaby,&rdquo; said the Rector, pausing with an
eggshell transfixed upon his spoon, &ldquo;shillings and half crowns
don&rsquo;t go far in the present condition of our households.&nbsp;
There are not ten families whose beds are not burnt.&nbsp; What do you
propose to do?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, when I have first confessed that my ideas
are not entirely original.&nbsp; I have been studying political economy
under that hard-headed Sandy, our friend the doctor.&nbsp; In the first
place, from to-morrow, we must cease to <i>give</i> any thing whatever,
and both announce that determination and stick to it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And <i>then,</i> my dear sir?&rdquo; said the Rector, smiling;
and nursing his black gaiter.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And <i>then,</i> my dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Ammaby, &ldquo;I
shall be able to get some men to do some work about my place, and those
people at a distance who have widows here will relieve them (at least
the widows will look up their well-to-do relatives), and the Church,
in your person, will not be charged.&nbsp; And some of the widows will
consent to scrub for payment, instead of sitting weeping in your kitchen
- also for payment.&nbsp; They will, furthermore, compel their interesting
sons to mind pigs, or scare birds, instead of hanging about the Heart
of Oak, begging of the visitors who now begin to invade us.&nbsp; Do
you know that the very boys won&rsquo;t settle to work, that the children
are taking to gutter-life and begging, that the women won&rsquo;t even
tidy up their houses, and that the men are retailing the horrors of
the fever in every alehouse in the county, instead of getting in the
crops?&nbsp; I give you my word, I had to go down to the inn yesterday,
and a lad of eleven or twelve, who didn&rsquo;t recognize me in Chuter&rsquo;s
dark kitchen, came up and began to beg with a whine that would have
done credit to a professional mendicant.&nbsp; I stood in the shadow
and let him tell his whole story, of a widowed mother and three brothers
and sisters living, and six dead; and when he&rsquo;d finished, and
two visitors were fumbling in their pockets, I took him by the collar
and lifted him clean through the kitchen and down the yard into the
street.&nbsp; I nearly knocked Swift over, or rather I nearly fell myself,
from concussion with his burly person, but he was the very man I wanted.&nbsp;
I said, &rsquo;Mr. Swift, may I ask you to do me a favor?&nbsp; This
boy - whose father was a respectable man - has been begging - <i>begging</i>!
in a public room.&nbsp; His excuse is that his mother is starving.&nbsp;
Will you kindly take him to the Hall, and put him in charge of the gardener,
with my strict orders that he is to do a good afternoon&rsquo;s work
at weeding in the shrubbery.&nbsp; And that the gardener is to see that
he comes every day at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and works there
till four in the afternoon, till the day you reopen school, meal-times
and Sundays excepted.&nbsp; I will pay his mother five shillings a week,
and, if he is a good boy, I&rsquo;ll give him some old clothes.&nbsp;
And if ever you see or hear of his disgracing himself and his friends
by begging again, if you don&rsquo;t thrash him within an inch of his
life, I shall.&rsquo;&nbsp; I promise you, the widow might starve for
the want of that five shillings if the young gentleman could slip out
of his bargain.&nbsp; His face was a study.&nbsp; But less so than the
schoolmaster&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The job exactly suited him, and I suspect
he knew the lad of old.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve heard Swift say, I fancy he sympathizes
with your theories,&rdquo; said the Rector.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I fear he sympathizes with my temper as well as my theories!&rdquo;
laughed the Squire.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I felt the flush on my own cheek-bone,
I caught the fire in his eye.&nbsp; But now, my dear sir, you will consent
to some strong measures to prevent the village becoming a mere nest
of <i>lazzaroni?</i>&nbsp; Let us try the system at any rate.&nbsp;
I propose that we do not shut up the soup kitchen yet, but charge a
small sum for the soup towards its expenses.&nbsp; And I want to beg
you to write another of those graphic and persuasive letters, in which
you have appealed to the sympathy of the public with our misfortune.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But, bless me!&rdquo; said the Rector, &ldquo;I thought you were
a foe to assisting the people, even out of their own parson&rsquo;s
pocket.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, I taunted the doctor myself with inconsistency, but we
do not propose to make a sixpenny dole of the fund.&nbsp; You know there
are certain things they can&rsquo;t do, and some help they seem fairly
entitled to receive.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve made them burn their bedding,
in the interests of the public safety, and it&rsquo;s only fair they
should be helped to replace it.&nbsp; Then there is a lot of sanitary
work which can only be done by a fund for the purpose; and, if we get
the money, we can employ idlers.&nbsp; The women will tidy their houses
when they see new blankets, and the sooner the churchyard is made nice,
and that monument of yours erected, and we all get into orderly, respectable
ways again, the better.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Enough, enough, my dear Ammaby!&rdquo; cried the Rector; &ldquo;I
put myself in your hands, and I will see to the public appeal at once;
though I may mention that the credit of those compositions chiefly belongs
to old Swift.&nbsp; He knows the <i>data</i> minutely, and he delights
in the putting together.&nbsp; I think he regards it as a species of
literary work.&nbsp; I hope you hear good news of Lady Louisa and little
Amabel?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They are quite well, thank you,&rdquo; said the Squire; &ldquo;they
are in town just now with Lady Craikshaw, who has gone up to consult
her London doctor.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, farewell, Ammaby, for the present.&nbsp; Tell the doctor
I&rsquo;ll give his plan a trial, and we&rsquo;ll get the place into
working order as fast as we can.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He will be charmed,&rdquo; said the Squire.&nbsp; &ldquo;He says,
as we are going on now, we are breeding two worse pests than the fever,
- contentment under remediable discomfort, and a dislike to work.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>
<br>
MR. FORD&rsquo;S CLIENT. - THE HISTORY OF JAN&rsquo;S FATHER - AMABEL
AND BOGY THE SECOND.<br>
<br>
Among the many sounds blended into that one which roared for ever round
Mr. Ford&rsquo;s offices in the city was the cry of the newsboys.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Horful p&rsquo;ticklers of the plague in a village in&nbsp; -
shire!&rdquo; they screamed under the windows.&nbsp; Not that Mr. Ford
heard them.&nbsp; But in five minutes the noiseless door opened, and
a clerk laid the morning paper on the table, and withdrew in silence.&nbsp;
Mr.&nbsp; Ford cut it leisurely with a large ivory knife, and skimmed
the news.&nbsp; His eye happened to fall upon the Rector&rsquo;s letter,
which, after a short summary of the history of the fever, pointed out
the objects for which help was immediately required.&nbsp; There was
a postscript.&nbsp; To give some idea of the ravages of the epidemic,
and as a proof that the calamity was not exaggerated, a list of some
of the worst cases was given, with names and particulars.&nbsp; It was
gloomy enough.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary Smith, lost her husband (a laborer)
and six children between the second and the ninth of the month.&nbsp;
George Harness, a blacksmith, lost his wife and four children.&nbsp;
Master Abel Lake, windmiller of the Tower Mill, lost all his children,
five in number, between the fifth and the fifteenth of the month.&nbsp;
His wife&rsquo;s health is completely broken up&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
At this point Mr. Ford dropped the paper, and, unlocking a drawer beside
him, referred to some memoranda, after which he cut out the Rector&rsquo;s
letter with a large pair of office scissors, and enclosed it in one
which he wrote before proceeding to any other business.&nbsp; He had
underlined one name in the doleful list, - <i>Abel Lake, windmiller.<br>
<br>
</i>Some hours later the silent clerk ushered in a visitor, one of Mr.
Ford&rsquo;s clients.&nbsp; He was a gentleman of middle height and
middle age, - the younger half of middle age, though his dark hair was
prematurely gray.&nbsp; His eyes were black and restless, and his manner
at once haughty and nervous.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am very glad to see you, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Ford,
suavely; &ldquo;I had just written you a note, the subject of which
I can now speak about.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as he spoke, Mr. Ford tore
open the letter which lay beside him, whilst his client was saying,
&ldquo;We are only passing through town on our way to Scotland.&nbsp;
I shall be here two nights.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You remember instructing me that it was your wish to economize
as much as possible during the minority of your son?&rdquo; said Mr.
Ford.&nbsp; His client nodded.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; continued the man of business, &ldquo;there is
a quarterly payment we have been in the habit of making on your account,
which is now at an end.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as he spoke, he pushed the
Rector&rsquo;s letter across the table, with his fingers upon the name
<i>Abel Lake, windmiller.</i>&nbsp; His client always spoke stiffly,
which made the effort with which he now spoke less noticed by the lawyer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I should like to be certain,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean,
that there is no exaggeration or mistake.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You have never communicated with the man, or given him any chance
of pestering you,&rdquo; said Mr. Ford.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should hardly
do so now, I think&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I certainly kept the power of reopening communication in my own
hands, knowing nothing of the man; but I should be sorry to discontinue
the allowance under a - a mistake of any kind.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Ford meditated.&nbsp; It may be said here that he by no means knew
all that the reader knows of Jan&rsquo;s history; but he saw that his
client was anxious not to withhold the money if the child were alive.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I think I have it, my dear sir,&rdquo; he said suddenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Allow me to write, in my own name, to this worthy clergyman.&nbsp;
I must ask you to subscribe to his fund, in my name, which will form
an excuse for the letter, and I will contrive to ask him if the list
of cases has been printed accurately, and has his sanction.&nbsp; If
there has been any error, we shall hear of it.&nbsp; The object of the
subscription is - let me see - is - a monument to those who have died
of the fever and&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
But the dark gentleman had started up abruptly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, Mr. Ford,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;your plan
is, as usual, excellent.&nbsp; Pray oblige me by sending ten guineas
in your own name, and you will let me know if - if there <i>is</i> any
mistake.&nbsp; I will call in to-morrow about other matters.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And before Mr. Ford could reply his client was gone.<br>
<br>
The peculiar solitude to be found in the crowded heart of London was
grateful to his present mood.&nbsp; To have been alone with his thoughts
in the country would have been intolerable.&nbsp; The fields smack of
innocence, and alone with them the past is apt to take the simple tints
of right and wrong in the memory.&nbsp; But in that seething mass, which
represents ten thousand heartaches and anxieties, doubtful shifts, and
open sins, as bad or worse than a man&rsquo;s own, there is a silent
sympathy and no reproach.&nbsp; Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client did not lean
back, the tension of his mind was too great.&nbsp; He sat stiffly, and
gazed vacantly before him, half seeing and half transforming into other
visions whatever lay before the hansom, as it wound its way through
the streets.&nbsp; Now for a moment a four-wheeled cab, loaded with
schoolboy luggage, occupied the field of view, and idle memories of
his own boyhood flitted over it.&nbsp; Then, crawling behind a dray,
some strange associations built up the barrels into an old weatherstained
wooden house in Holland, and for a while an intense realization of past
scenes which love had made happy put present anxieties to sleep.&nbsp;
But they woke again with a horrible pang, as a grim, hideous funeral
car drove slowly past, nodding like a nightmare.<br>
<br>
As the traffic became less dense, and the cab went faster, the man&rsquo;s
thoughts went faster too.&nbsp; He strove to do what he had not often
tried, to review his life.&nbsp; He had unconsciously gained the will
to do it, because a reparation which conscience might hitherto have
pressed on him was now impossible, and because the plague that had desolated
Abel Lake&rsquo;s home had swept the skeleton out of his own cupboard,
and he could repent of the past and do his duty in the future.&nbsp;
His conscience was stronger than his courage.&nbsp; He had long wished
to repent, though he had not found strength to repair.<br>
<br>
On one point he did not delude himself as he looked back over his life.&nbsp;
He had no sentimental regrets for the careless happiness of youth.&nbsp;
Is any period of human life so tormented with cares as a self-indulgent
youth?&nbsp; He had been a slave to expensive habits, to social traditions,
to past follies, ever since he could remember.&nbsp; He had been in
debt, in pocket or in conscience, from his schoolboy days to this hour.&nbsp;
His tradesmen were paid long since, and, if death had cancelled what
else he owed, how easy virtue would henceforth be!<br>
<br>
It had not been easy at the date of his first marriage.&nbsp; He was
deeply in debt, and out of favor with his father.&nbsp; It was on both
accounts that he went abroad for some months.&nbsp; In Holland he married.&nbsp;
His wife was Jan&rsquo;s mother, and Jan was their only child.<br>
<br>
Her people were of middle rank, leading quiet though cultivated lives.&nbsp;
Her mother was dead, and she was her old father&rsquo;s only child.&nbsp;
It would be doing injustice to the kind of love with which she inspired
her husband to dwell much upon her beauty, though it was of that high
type which takes possession of the memory for ever.&nbsp; She was very
intensely, brilliantly fair, so that in a crowd her face shone out like
a star.&nbsp; Time never dimmed one golden thread in her hair; and Death,
who had done so much for Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client, could not wash that
face from his brain.&nbsp; It blotted the traffic out of the streets,
and in their place Dutch pastures, whose rich green levels were unbroken
by hedge or wall, stretched flatly to the horizon.&nbsp; It bent over
a drawing on his knee as he and she sat sketching together in an old-world
orchard, where the trees bore more moss than fruit.&nbsp; The din of
London was absolutely unheard by Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client, but he heard
her voice, saying, &ldquo;You must learn to paint cattle, if you mean
to make any thing of Dutch scenery.&nbsp; And also, where the earth
gives so little variety, one must study the sky.&nbsp; We have no mountains,
but we have clouds.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in the orchard, under the apple-tree,
across the sketch-book, that they had plighted their troth - ten years
ago.<br>
<br>
They were married.&nbsp; Had he ever denied himself a single gratification,
because it would add another knot to the tangle of his career?&nbsp;
He had pacified creditors by incurring fresh debts, and had evaded catastrophes
by involving himself in new complications all his life.&nbsp; His marriage
was accomplished at the expense of a train of falsehoods, but his father-in-law
was an unworldly old man, not difficult to deceive.&nbsp; He spent most
of the next ten months in Holland, and, apart from his anxieties, it
was the purest, happiest time he had ever known.&nbsp; Then his father
recalled him peremptorily to England.<br>
<br>
When Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client obeyed his father&rsquo;s summons, the
climax of his difficulties seemed at hand.&nbsp; The old man was anxious
for a reconciliation, but resolved that his son should &ldquo;settle
in life;&rdquo; and he had found a wife for him, the daughter of a Scotch
nobleman, young, handsome, and with a good fortune.&nbsp; He gave him
a fortnight for consideration.&nbsp; If he complied, the old man promised
to pay his debts, to make him a liberal allowance, and to be in every
way indulgent.&nbsp; If he thwarted his plans, he threatened to allow
him nothing during his lifetime, and to leave him nothing that he could
avoid bequeathing at his death.<br>
<br>
It was at this juncture that Jan&rsquo;s mother followed her husband
to England.&nbsp; Her anxieties were not silenced by excuses which satisfied
her father.&nbsp; The crisis could hardly have been worse.&nbsp; Mr.
Ford&rsquo;s client felt that confession was now inevitable; and that
he could confess more easily by letter when he reached London.&nbsp;
But before the letter was written, his wife died.<br>
<br>
Weak men, harassed by personal anxieties, become hard in proportion
to their selfish fears.&nbsp; It is like the cruelty that comes of terror.&nbsp;
He had loved his wife; but he was terribly pressed, and there came a
sense of relief even with the bitterness of the knowledge that he was
free.&nbsp; He took the body to Holland, to be buried under the shadow
of the little wooden church where they were married; and to the desolate
old father he promised to bring his grandson - Jan.&nbsp; But just after
the death of an old nurse, in whose care he had placed his child, another
crisis came to Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client.&nbsp; On the same day he got
letters from his father and from his father-in-law.&nbsp; From the first,
to press his instant return home; from the second, to say that, if he
could not at once bring Jan, the old man would make the effort of a
voyage to England to fetch him.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s father almost hated
him.&nbsp; That the child should have lived when the beloved mother
died was in itself an offence.&nbsp; But that that freedom, and peace,
and prosperity, which were so dearly purchased by her death, should
be risked afresh by him, was irritating to a degree.&nbsp; He was frantic.&nbsp;
It was impossible to fail that very peremptory old gentleman, his father.&nbsp;
It was out of the question to allow his father-in-law to come to England.&nbsp;
He could not throw away all his prospects.&nbsp; And the more he thought
of it, the more certain it seemed that Jan&rsquo;s existence would for
ever tie him to Holland; that for his grandson&rsquo;s sake the old
man would investigate his affairs, and that the truth would come out
sooner or later.&nbsp; The very devil suggested to him that if the child
had died with its mother he would have been quite free, and intercourse
with Holland would have died away naturally.&nbsp; He wished to forget.&nbsp;
To a nature of his type, when even such a love as he had been privileged
to enjoy had become a memory involving pain, it was instinctively evaded
like any other unpleasant thing.&nbsp; He resolved, at last, to let
nothing stand between him and reconciliation with his father.&nbsp;
Once more he must desperately mortgage the future for present emergencies.&nbsp;
He wrote to the old father-in-law to say that the child was dead.&nbsp;
He excused this to himself on the ground of Jan&rsquo;s welfare.&nbsp;
If the truth became fully known, and his father threw him off, he would
be a poor embarrassed man, and could do little for his child.&nbsp;
But with his father&rsquo;s fortune, and, perhaps, the Scotch lady&rsquo;s
fortune, it would be in his power to give Jan a brilliant future, <i>even</i>
<i>if</i> he never fully acknowledged him.&nbsp; As yet he hardly recognized
such an unnatural possibility.&nbsp; He said to himself, that when he
was free, all would be well, and the Dutch grandfather would forgive
the lie in the joy of discovering that Jan was alive, and would be so
well provided for.<br>
<br>
Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client was reconciled to his father.&nbsp; He married
Lady Adelaide, and announced the marriage to his father-in-law.&nbsp;
After which, his intercourse with Holland died out.<br>
<br>
It was a curious result of a marriage so made that it was a very happy
one.&nbsp; Still more curious was the likeness, both physical and mental,
between the second wife and the first.&nbsp; Lady Adelaide was half
Scotch and half English, a blonde of the most brilliant type, and of
an intellectual order of beauty.&nbsp; But fair women are common enough.&nbsp;
It was stranger still that the best affections of two women of so high
a moral and intellectual standard should have been devoted to the same
and to such a husband.&nbsp; Not quite in vain.&nbsp; Indeed, but for
that grievous sin towards his eldest son, Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client would
probably have become an utterly different man.&nbsp; But there is no
rising far in the moral atmosphere with a wilful, unrepented sin as
a clog.&nbsp; It was a miserable result of the weakness of his character
that he could not see that the very nobleness of Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s
should have encouraged him to confess to her what he dared not trust
to his father&rsquo;s imperious, petulant affection.&nbsp; But he was
afraid of her.&nbsp; It had been the same with his first wife.&nbsp;
He had dreaded that she should discover his falsehoods far more than
he had feared his father-in-law.&nbsp; And years of happy companionship
made it even less tolerable to him to think of lowering himself in Lady
Adelaide&rsquo;s regard.<br>
<br>
But there was a far more overwhelming consideration which had been gathering
strength for eight years between him and the idea of recognizing Jan
as his eldest son, and his heir.&nbsp; He had another son, Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s
only child.&nbsp; If he had hesitated when the boy was only a baby to
tell her that her darling was not his only son, it was less and less
easy to him to think of bringing Jan, - of whom he knew nothing - from
the rough life of the mill to supplant Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s child,
when the boy grew more charming as every year went by.&nbsp; Clever,
sweet-tempered, of aristocratic appearance, idolized by the relatives
of both his parents, he seemed made by Providence to do credit to the
position to which he was believed to have been born.<br>
<br>
Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client had almost made the resolve against which that
fair face that was not Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s for ever rose up in judgment:
he was just deciding to put Jan to school, and to give up all idea of
taking him home, when death seemed once more to have solved his difficulties.&nbsp;
An unwonted ease came into his heart.&nbsp; Surely Heaven, knowing how
sincerely he wished to be good, was making goodness easy to him, - was
permitting him to settle with his conscience on cheaper terms than those
of repentance and restitution.&nbsp; (And indeed, if amendment, of the
weak as well as of the strong, be GOD&rsquo;S great purpose for us,
who shall say that the ruggedness of the narrow road is not often smoothed
for stumbling feet?)&nbsp; The fever seemed quite providential, and
Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client felt quite pious about it.&nbsp; He was conscious
of no mockery in dwelling to himself on the thought that Jan was &ldquo;better
off&rdquo; in Paradise with his mother.&nbsp; And he himself was safe
- for the first time since he could remember, - free at last to become
worthier, with no black shadow at his heels.&nbsp; Very touching was
his resolve that he would be a better father to his son than his own
father had been to him.&nbsp; If be could not train him in high principles
and self-restraint, he would at least be indulgent to the consequences
of his own indulgence, and never drive him to those fearful straits.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll be a very different young man from what I was,&rdquo;
was his final thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks to his good mother.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
His mind was full of Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s goodness as he entered his
house, and she met him in the hall.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah, Edward!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I am so glad you&rsquo;ve
come home.&nbsp; I want you to see that quaint child I was telling you
about.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Ford&rsquo;s
client.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking very tired,&rdquo; said Lady Adelaide, gently;
&ldquo;but about the child.&nbsp; It is Lady Louisa Ammaby&rsquo;s little
girl.&nbsp; You know I met her just before we left Brighton.&nbsp; I
only saw the child once, but it is the quaintest, most original little
being!&nbsp; So unlike its mother!&nbsp; She and her mother are in town,
and they were going out to luncheon to-day I found, so I asked the child
here to dine with D&rsquo;Arcy.&nbsp; Her <i>bonne</i> is taking off
her things, and I must go and bring her down.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As Lady Adelaide went out, her son came in, and rushed up to his father.&nbsp;
If Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client had failed in natural affection for one son,
his love for the other had a double intensity.&nbsp; He put his arm
tenderly round him, whilst the boy told some long childish story, which
was not finished when Lady Adelaide returned, leading Amabel by the
hand.&nbsp; Amabel was a good deal taller.&nbsp; Her large feet were
adorned with ornamental thread socks, and leathern shoes buttoned round
the ankle.&nbsp; Her hair was cropped, because Lady Craikshaw said this
made it grow.&nbsp; She wore a big pinafore by the same authority, in
spite of which she carried herself with an admirable dignity.&nbsp;
The same candor, good sense, and resolution shone from her clear eyes
and fat cheeks as of old.&nbsp; Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client was alarming
to children, but Amabel shook hands courageously with him.<br>
<br>
She was accustomed to exercise courage in her behavior.&nbsp; From her
earliest days a standard of manners had been expected of her beyond
her age.&nbsp; It was a consequence of her growth.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
quite a big girl now,&rdquo; was a nursery reproach addressed to her
at least two years before the time, and she tried valiantly to live
up to her inches.<br>
<br>
But when Amabel saw D&rsquo;Arcy, she started and stopped short.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you shake hands with my boy, Amabel?&rdquo; said
Lady Adelaide.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you must make friends with him, and
he&rsquo;ll give you a ride on the rocking-horse after dinner.&nbsp;
Surely such a big girl can&rsquo;t be shy?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Goaded by the old reproach, Amabel made an effort, and, advancing by
herself, held out her hand, and said, &ldquo;How do you do, Bogy?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s black eyes twinkled with merriment.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
do you do, Mother Bunch?&rdquo; said he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My <i>dear</i> D&rsquo;Arcy!&rdquo; said Lady Adelaide, reproachfully.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mamma, I am not rude.&nbsp; I am only joking.&nbsp; She calls
me Bogy, so I call her Mother Bunch.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> Mother Bunch,&rdquo; said Amabel.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not Bogy,&rdquo; retorted D&rsquo;Arcy.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, you are,&rdquo; said Amabel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only you had very
old clothes on in the wood.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Lady Craikshaw had cruelly warned Lady Adelaide that Amabel sometimes
told stories, and, thinking that the child was romancing, Lady Adelaide
tried to change the subject.&nbsp; But D&rsquo;Arcy cried, &ldquo;Oh,
do let her talk, mamma.&nbsp; I do so like her.&nbsp; She is such fun!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to laugh at me,&rdquo; said poor Amabel, as
D&rsquo;Arcy took her into the dining-room, &ldquo;I gave you my paint-box.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The boy&rsquo;s stare of amazement awoke a doubt in Amabel&rsquo;s mind
of his identity with the Bogy of the woods.&nbsp; Between constantly
peeping at him, and her anxiety to conduct herself conformably to her
size in the etiquette of the dinner-table, she did not eat much.&nbsp;
When dinner was over, and D&rsquo;Arcy led her away to the rocking horse,
he asked, &ldquo;Do you still think I&rsquo;m Bogy?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;N - no,&rdquo; said Amabel, &ldquo;I think perhaps you&rsquo;re
not.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re very like him, though you talk differently.&nbsp;
Do you make pictures?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
D&rsquo;Arcy shook his head.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not even of leaves?&rdquo; said Amabel.<br>
<br>
When she was going away, D&rsquo;Arcy asked, &ldquo;Which do you like
best, me or Bogy?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Amabel pondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like you very much.&nbsp; You made the
rocking-horse go so fast; but I liked Bogy.&nbsp; He carried me all
up the hill, and he picked up my moss.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of
him.&nbsp; I gave him a kiss.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, give me a kiss,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arcy.&nbsp; But there
was a tone of raillery in his voice which put Amabel on her dignity,
and she shook her head, and began to go down the steps of the house,
one leg at a time.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m Bogy, you know, you <i>have</i> kissed me <i>once</i>,&rdquo;
shouted D&rsquo;Arcy.&nbsp; But Amabel&rsquo;s wits were as well developed
as her feet.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Once is enough for bogies,&rdquo; said she, and went sturdily
away.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXIX.<br>
<br>
JAN FULFILS ABEL&rsquo;S CHARGE. - SON OF THE MILL. - THE LARGE-MOUTHED
WOMAN.<br>
<br>
By the time Jan went back to the windmill he was quite well.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be fit for the walk by I open school,&rdquo; said
Master Swift.<br>
<br>
Jan promised himself that he would redouble his pains in class, from
gratitude to the good schoolmaster.&nbsp; But it was not to be.<br>
<br>
The day before the school opened, Jan came to the cottage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Master
Swift,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I be come to tell ye that I be afraid
I can&rsquo;t come to school.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Master Swift.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, Master Swift, I do think I be wanted at home.&nbsp; My
father&rsquo;s not got Abel now; but it&rsquo;s my mother that mostly
wants me.&nbsp; I be bothered about mother, somehow,&rdquo; said Jan,
with an anxious look.&nbsp; &ldquo;She do forget things so, and be so
queer.&nbsp; She left the beer-tap running yesterday, and near two gallons
of ale ran out; and this morning she put the kettle on, and no water
in it.&nbsp; And she do cry terrible,&rdquo; Jan added, breaking down
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;But Abel says to me the day he was took ill, &rsquo;Janny,&rsquo;
he says, &rsquo;look to mother.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so I will.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good lad, Jan,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sit ye down and get your tea, and I&rsquo;ll come back with ye
to the mill.&nbsp; A bit of company does folk good that&rsquo;s beside
themselves with fretting.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But the windmiller&rsquo;s wife was beyond such simple cure.&nbsp; The
overtasked brain was giving way, and though there were from time to
time such capricious changes in her condition as led Jan to hope she
was better, she became more and more imbecile to the end of her life.<br>
<br>
To say that he was a devoted son is to give a very vague idea of his
life at this time to those for whom filial duty takes the shape of compliance
rather than of action, or to those who have no experience of domestic
attendance on the infirm both of body and of mind.<br>
<br>
It was not in moments of tender feeling, or at his prayers, or by Abel&rsquo;s
grave, that Jan recalled his foster-brother&rsquo;s dying charge; but
as he emptied slops, cleaned grates, or fastened Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s black
dress behind.&nbsp; Nor did gratitude flatter his zeal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boys
do be so ackered with hooks and eyes,&rdquo; the poor woman grumbled
in her fretfulness, and then she sat down to bemoan herself that she
had not a daughter left.&nbsp; She had got a trick of stopping short
half way through her dressing, and giving herself up to tears, which
led to Jan&rsquo;s assisting at her toilette.&nbsp; He was soon expert
enough with hooks and eyes, the more tedious matter was getting up her
courage, which invariably failed her at the stage of her linsey-woolsey
petticoat.&nbsp; But when Jan had hooked her up, and tied her apron
on, and put a little shawl about her shoulders, and got her close-fitting
cap set straight, - a matter about as easy as putting another man&rsquo;s
spectacles on his nose, - and seated her by the fire, the worst was
over.&nbsp; Mrs. Lake always cheered up after breakfast, and Jan always
to the very end hoped that this was the beginning of her getting better.<br>
<br>
Even after a niece of the windmiller&rsquo;s came to live at the mill,
and to wait on Mrs. Lake, the poor woman was never really content without
Jan.&nbsp; As time went on, she wept less, but her faculties became
more clouded.&nbsp; She had some brighter hours, and the company of
the schoolmaster gave her pleasure, and seemed to do her good.&nbsp;
When the Rector visited her, his very sympathy made him delicate about
dwelling on her bereavement.&nbsp; When the poor woman sobbed, he changed
the subject in haste, and his condolences were of a very general character.&nbsp;
But Master Swift had no such scruples; and as he sat by her chair, with
a kindly hand on hers, he spoke both plainly and loudly.&nbsp; The latter
because Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s hearing had become dull.&nbsp; Nor did he
cease to speak because tears dropped perpetually from the eyes which
were turned to him, and which seemed day by day to lose color from the
pupils, and to grow redder round the lids from weeping.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Them that sleep in Jesus shall GOD bring with Him.&nbsp; Ah!
Mrs. Lake, ma&rsquo;am, they&rsquo;re grand words for you and me.&nbsp;
The Lord has dealt hardly with us, but there are folk that lose their
children when it&rsquo;s worse.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many a Christian
parent has lived to see them grow up to wickedness, and has lost &rsquo;em
in their sins, and has had to carry <i>that</i> weight in his heart
besides their loss, that the Lord&rsquo;s counsels for them were dark
to him.&nbsp; But for yours and mine, woman, that have gone home in
their innocence, what have we to say to the Almighty, except to pray
of Him to make us fitter to take them when He brings them back?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Through the cloud that hung over the poor woman&rsquo;s spirit, Master
Swift&rsquo;s plain consolations made their way.&nbsp; The ruling thought
of his mind became the one idea to which her unhinged intellect clung,
- the second coming of the Lord.&nbsp; For this she watched - not merely
in the sense of a readiness for judgment, but - out of the upper windows
of the windmill, from which could be seen a vast extent of that heaven
in which the sign of the Son of Man should be, before He came.<br>
<br>
Sky-gazing was an old habit with Jan, and his active imagination was
not slow to follow his foster-mother&rsquo;s fancies.&nbsp; The niece
did all the house-work, for the freakish state of Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s
memory made her help too uncertain to be trusted to.&nbsp; But, with
a restlessness which was perhaps part of her disease, she wandered from
story to story of the windmill, guided by Jan, and the windmiller made
no objection.<br>
<br>
The country folk who brought grist to the mill would strain their ears
with a sense of awe to catch Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s mutterings as she glided
hither and thither with that mysterious shadow on her spirit, and the
miller himself paid a respect to her intellect now it was shattered
which he had not paid whilst it was whole.&nbsp; Indeed he was very
kind to her, and every Sunday he led her tenderly to church, where the
music soothed her as it soothed Saul of old.&nbsp; As the brain failed,
she became happier, but her sorrow was like a pain numbed by narcotics;
it awoke again from time to time.&nbsp; She would fancy the children
were with her, and then suddenly arouse to the fact that they were not,
and moan that she had lost all.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;ve got one left, mother dear,&rdquo; Jan would cry,
and his caresses comforted her.&nbsp; But at times she was troubled
by an imperfect remembrance of Jan&rsquo;s history, and, with some echo
of her old reluctance to adopt him, she would wail that she &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
want a stranger child.&rdquo;&nbsp; It cut Jan to the heart.&nbsp; Ever
since he had known that he was not a miller&rsquo;s son, he had protested
against the knowledge.&nbsp; He loved the windmill and the windmiller&rsquo;s
trade.&nbsp; He loved his foster-parents, and desired no others.&nbsp;
He had a miller&rsquo;s thumb, and he flattened it with double pains
now that his right to it was disputed.&nbsp; He would press Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s
thin fingers against it in proof that he belonged to her, and the simple
wile was successful, for she would smile and say, &ldquo;Ay, ay, love!&nbsp;
Thee&rsquo;s a miller&rsquo;s boy, for thee&rsquo;ve got the miller&rsquo;s
thumb.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Two or three causes combined to strengthen Jan&rsquo;s love for his
home.&nbsp; His revolt from the fact that he was no windmiller born
gave the energy of contradiction.&nbsp; Then to fulfil Abel&rsquo;s
behests, and to take his place in the mill, was now Jan&rsquo;s chief
ambition.&nbsp; And whence could be seen such glorious views as from
the windows of a windmill?<br>
<br>
Master Lake was very glad of his help.&nbsp; The quarterly payment had
now been due for some weeks, but, in telling the schoolmaster, he only
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be as well pleased if they forgot un altogether,
now.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want him took away, no time.&nbsp; And now
I&rsquo;ve lost Abel, Jan&rsquo;ll have the mill after me.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
a good son is Jan.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And, as he echoed Jan&rsquo;s praises, it never dawned on Master Swift
that he was the cause of the allowance having stopped.&nbsp; Jan was
jealous of his title as Master Lake&rsquo;s son, but the schoolmaster
dwelt much in his own mind on the fact that Jan was no real child of
the district; partly in his ambition for him, and partly out of a dim
hope that he would himself be some day allowed to adopt him.&nbsp; In
stating that the windmiller had lost all his children by the fever,
he had stated the bare fact in all good faith; and as neither he nor
the Rector guessed the real drift of Mr. Ford&rsquo;s letter, the mistake
was never corrected.<br>
<br>
Jan was useful in the mill.&nbsp; He swept the round-house, coupled
the sacks, received grist from the grist-bringers, and took payment
for the grinding in money or in kind, according to custom.&nbsp; The
old women who toddled in with their bags of gleaned corn looked very
kindly on him, and would say, &ldquo;Thee be a good bwoy, sartinly,
Jan, and the Lard&rsquo;ll reward thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the windmiller
came towards one of these dames, she would say, &ldquo;Aal right, Master
Lake, I be in no manners of hurry, Jan&rsquo;ll do for me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And, when Jan came, his business-like method justified her confidence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good day, mother,&rdquo; he would say.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will ye pay,
or toll it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless ye, dear love, how should I pay?&rdquo;
the old woman would reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll toll it, Jan, and
thank ye kindly.&rdquo;&nbsp; On which Jan would dip the wooden bowl
or tolling-dish into the sack, and the corn it brought up was the established
rate of payment for grinding the rest.<br>
<br>
But, though he constantly assured the schoolmaster that he meant to
be a windmiller, Jan did not neglect his special gift.&nbsp; He got
up with many a dawn to paint the sunrise.&nbsp; In still summer afternoons,
when the mill-sails were idle, and Mrs. Lake was dozing from the heat,
he betook himself to the water-meads to sketch.&nbsp; In the mill itself
he made countless studies.&nbsp; Not only of the ever-changing heavens,
and of the monotonous sweeps of the great plains, whose aspect is more
changeable than one might think, but studies on the various floors of
the mill, and in the roundhouse, where old meal-bins and swollen sacks
looked picturesque in the dim light falling from above, in which also
the circular stones, the shaft, and the very hoppers, became effective
subjects for the Cumberland lead-pencils.<br>
<br>
Towards the end of the summer following the fever, Mrs. Lake failed
rapidly.&nbsp; She sat out of doors most of the day, the miller moving
her chair from one side to another of the mill to get the shade.&nbsp;
Master Swift brought her big nosegays from his garden, at which she
would smell for hours, as if the scent soothed her.&nbsp; She spoke
very little, but she watched the sky constantly.<br>
<br>
One evening there was a gorgeous sunset.&nbsp; In all its splendor,
with a countless multitude of little clouds about it bright with its
light, the glory of the sun seemed little less than that of the Lord
Himself, coming with ten thousand of His saints, and the poor woman
gazed as if her withered, wistful eyes could see her children among
the radiant host.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do think the Lord be coming to-night,
Master Swift,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And He&rsquo;ll bring them
with Him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She gazed on after all the glory had faded, and lingered till it grew
dark, and the schoolmaster had gone home.&nbsp; It was not till her
dress was quite wet with dew that Jan insisted upon her going indoors.<br>
<br>
They were coming round the mill in the dusk, when a cry broke from Mrs.
Lake&rsquo;s lips; which was only an echo of a louder one from Jan.&nbsp;
A woman creeping round the mill in the opposite direction had just craned
her neck forward so that Jan and his foster-mother saw her face for
an instant before it disappeared.&nbsp; Why Jan was so terrified, he
would have been puzzled to say, for the woman was not hideous, though
she had an ugly mouth.&nbsp; But he was terrified, and none the less
so from a conviction that she was looking intently and intentionally
at him.&nbsp; When he got his foster-mother indoors, the miller was
disposed to think the affair was a fancy; but, as if the shock had given
a spur to her feeble senses, Mrs. Lake said in a loud clear voice, &ldquo;Maester,
it be the woman that brought our Jan hither!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But when the miller ran out, no one was to be seen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXX.<br>
<br>
JAN&rsquo;S PROSPECTS AND MASTER SWIFT&rsquo;S PLANS. - TEA AND MILTON.
- NEW PARENTS. - PARTING WITH RUFUS. - JAN IS KIDNAPPED.<br>
<br>
This shock seemed to give a last jar to the frail state of Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s
health, and the sleep into which she fell that night passed into a state
of insensibility in which her sorely tried spirit was released without
pain.<br>
<br>
It was said that the windmiller looked twice his age from trouble.&nbsp;
But his wan appearance may have been partly due to the inroads of a
lung disease, which comes to millers from constantly inhaling the flour-dust.&nbsp;
His cheeks grew hollow, and his wasted hands displayed the windmiller&rsquo;s
coat of arms <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a> with
painful distinctness.&nbsp; The schoolmaster spent most of his evenings
at the mill; but sometimes Jan went to tea with him, and by Master Lake&rsquo;s
own desire he went to school once more.<br>
<br>
Master Swift thought none the less of Jan&rsquo;s prospects that it
was useless to discuss them with Master Lake.&nbsp; All his plans were
founded on the belief that he himself would live to train the boy to
be a windmiller, whilst Master Swift&rsquo;s had reference to the conviction
that &ldquo;miller&rsquo;s consumption&rdquo; would deprive Jan of his
foster-father long before he was old enough to succeed him.&nbsp; And
had the miller made his will?&nbsp; Master Swift made his, and left
his few savings to Jan.&nbsp; He could not help hoping for some turn
of Fortune&rsquo;s wheel which should give the lad to him for his own.<br>
<br>
Jan was not likely to lack friends.&nbsp; The Squire had heard with
amazement that Master Chuter&rsquo;s new sign was the work of a child,
and he offered to place him under proper instruction to be trained as
an artist.&nbsp; But, at the time that this offer came, Jan was waiting
on his foster mother, and he refused to betray Abel&rsquo;s trust.&nbsp;
The Rector also wished to provide for him, but he was even more easily
convinced that Jan&rsquo;s present duty lay at home.&nbsp; Master Swift
too urged this in all good faith, but his personal love for Jan, and
the dread of parting with him, had an influence of which he was hardly
conscious.<br>
<br>
One evening, a few weeks after Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s death, Jan had tea,
followed by poetry, with the schoolmaster.&nbsp; Master Swift often
recited at the windmill.&nbsp; The miller liked to hear hymns his wife
had liked, and a few patriotic and romantic verses; but he yawned over
Milton, and fell asleep under Keats, so the schoolmaster reserved his
favorites for Jan&rsquo;s ear alone.<br>
<br>
When tea was over, Jan sat on the rush-bottomed chair, with his feet
on Rufus, on that side of the hearth which faced the window, and on
the other side sat Master Swift, with the mongrel lying by him, and
he spouted from Milton.&nbsp; Jan, familiar with many a sunrise, listened
with parted lips of pleasure, as the old man trolled forth, -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right against the eastern gate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the great sun begins his state,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robed in flames and amber light,&rdquo;<br>
<br>
and with even more sympathy to the latter part of &rsquo;Il Penseroso;&rsquo;
and, as when this was ended he begged for yet more, the old man began
&rsquo;Lycidas.&rsquo;&nbsp; He knew most of it by heart, and waving
his hand, with his eyes fixed expressively on Jan, he cried, -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fame is the spur that the clear
spirit doth raise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That last infirmity of noble minds)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To scorn delights, and live laborious
days.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And tears filled his eyes, and made his voice husky, as he went on,
-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But the fair guerdon when we hope
to find,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think to burst out into sudden
blaze,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes the blind Fury with the abhorred
shears&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
Master Swift stopped suddenly.&nbsp; Rufus was growling, and Jan was
white and rigid, with his eyes fixed on the window.<br>
<br>
As in most North countrymen, there was in the schoolmaster an ineradicable
touch of superstition.&nbsp; He cursed the &ldquo;unlucky&rdquo; poem,
and flinging the book from him ran to his favorite.&nbsp; As soon as
Jan could speak, he gasped, &ldquo;The woman that brought me to the
mill!&rdquo;&nbsp; But when Master Swift went to search the garden he
could find no one.<br>
<br>
Remembering the former alarm, and that no one was to be seen then, Master
Swift came to the conclusion that in each case it was a delusion.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a dear good lad, Jan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
ye&rsquo;ve fagged yourself out.&nbsp; Take the dog with ye to-morrow
for company, and your sketch-book, and amuse yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
not expect ye at school.&nbsp; And get away to your bed now.&nbsp; I
told Master Lake I shouldn&rsquo;t let ye away to-night.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan went to bed, and next morning was up with the lark, and with Rufus
at his heels went off to a distant place, where from a mound, where
a smaller road crossed the highway to London, there was a view which
he wished to sketch under an early light.&nbsp; As he drew near, he
saw a small cart, at one side of which the horse was feeding, and at
the foot of the mound sat a woman with a pedler&rsquo;s basket.<br>
<br>
When Jan recognized her, it was too late to run away.&nbsp; And whither
could he have run?&nbsp; The four white roads gleamed unsheltered over
the plains; there was no place to hide in, and not a soul in sight.<br>
<br>
When the large-mouthed woman seized Jan in her arms, and kissing him
cried aloud, &ldquo;Here he is at last!&nbsp; My child, my long lost
child!&rdquo; the despair which sank into the poor boy&rsquo;s heart
made him speechless.&nbsp; Was it possible that this woman was his mother?&nbsp;
His foster-mother&rsquo;s words tolled like a knell in his ears, - &ldquo;The
woman that brought our Jan hither.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the sound of Sal&rsquo;s
voice the hunchback appeared from behind the cart, and his wife dragged
Jan towards him, crying, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our dear son! our pretty,
clever little son.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I bean&rsquo;t your son!&rdquo; cried poor Jan, desperately.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; For a moment the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s
wife seemed staggered; but unluckily Jan added, &ldquo;She died last
month,&rdquo; and it was evident that he knew nothing of his real history.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, them mill people, them false wretches!&rdquo; screamed the
woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I been a paying &rsquo;em for my precious child,
all this time, for &rsquo;em to teach him to deny his own mother!&nbsp;
The brutes!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan&rsquo;s face and eyes blazed with passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;How dare
you abuse my good father and mother!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You</i>
be the wretch, and&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
But at this, and the same moment, the Cheap Jack seized Jan furiously
by the throat, and Rufus sprang upon the hunchback.&nbsp; The hunchback
was in the greater danger, from which only his wife&rsquo;s presence
of mind saved him.&nbsp; She shrieked to him to let Jan go, that he
might call off the dog, which the vindictive little Cheap Jack was loath
to do.&nbsp; And when Jan had got Rufus off, and was holding him by
the collar, the hunchback seized a hatchet with which he had been cutting
stakes, and rushed upon the dog.&nbsp; Jan put himself between them,
crying incoherently, &ldquo;Let him alone!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not mine
- he won&rsquo;t hurt you - I&rsquo;ll send him home - I&rsquo;ll let
un loose if ye don&rsquo;t;&rdquo; and Sal held back her husband, and
said, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll behave civil, Jan, my dear, and as you
should do to your poor mother, you may send the dog home.&nbsp; And
well for him too, for John&rsquo;s a man that&rsquo;s not very particular
what he does to them that puts him out in a place like this where there&rsquo;s
no one to tell tales.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d chop him limb from limb, as soon
as not.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan shuddered.&nbsp; There was no choice but to save Rufus.&nbsp; He
clung round the curly brown neck in one agonized embrace, and then steadied
his voice for an authoritative, &ldquo;Home, Rufus!&rdquo; as he let
him go.&nbsp; Rufus hesitated, and looked dangerously at the hunchback,
who lifted the hatchet.&nbsp; Jan shouted angrily, &ldquo;Home, Rufus!&rdquo;
and Rufus obeyed.&nbsp; Twenty times, as his familiar figure, with the
plumy tail curled sideways, lessened along the road, was Jan tempted
to call him back to his destruction; but he did not.&nbsp; Only when
the brown speck was fairly lost to sight, his utter friendlessness overwhelmed
him, and falling on his knees he besought the woman with tears to let
him go, - at least to tell Master Lake all about it.<br>
<br>
The hunchback began to reply with angry oaths, but Sal made signs to
him to be silent, and said, &ldquo;It comes very hard to me, Jan, to
be treated this way by my only son, but, if you&rsquo;ll be a good boy,
I&rsquo;m willing to oblige you, and we&rsquo;ll drive round by the
mill to let you see your friends, though it&rsquo;s out of the way too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan was profuse of thanks, and by the woman&rsquo;s desire he sat down
to share their breakfast.&nbsp; The hunchback examined his sketch-book,
and, as he laid it down again, he asked, &ldquo;Did you ever make picters
on stone, eh?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Before I could get paper, I did, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But could you now?&nbsp; Could you make &rsquo;em on a flat stone,
like a paving-stone?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d any thing to draw with, I could,&rdquo; said Jan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I could draw on any thing, if I had something in my hand to draw
with.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Cheap Jack&rsquo;s face became brighter, and in a mollified tone
he said to his wife, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a prime card for such a young
un.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a rum thing, too!&nbsp; A man I knowed was grand
at screeving, but he said himself he was nowheres on paper.&nbsp; He
made fifteen to eighteen shillin&rsquo; a week on a average,&rdquo;
the hunchback continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve knowed him take two
pound.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Did you ever draw fish, my dear?&rdquo; he inquired.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve drawn pigs
and dogs, and I be mostly able to draw any thing I sees, I think.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Cheap Jack whistled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Profiles pays well,&rdquo; he
murmured; &ldquo;but the tip is the Young Prodigy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so pleased to see what a clever boy you are, Jan,&rdquo;
said Sal; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all, my dear.&nbsp; Put the bridle on
the horse, John, for we&rsquo;ve got to go round by the mill.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Whilst the Cheap Jack obeyed her, Sal poked in the cart, from which
she returned with three tumblers on a plate.&nbsp; She gave one to her
husband, took one herself, and gave the third to Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to your health, love,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;drink
to mine, Jan, and I&rsquo;ll be a good mother to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jan
tasted, and put his glass down again, choking.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
so strong!&rdquo; he said.<br>
<br>
The Cheap Jack looked furious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nice manners they&rsquo;ve
taught this brat of yours!&rdquo; he cried to Sal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do ye
think I&rsquo;m going to take my &rsquo;oss a mile out of the road to
take him to see his friends, when he won&rsquo;t so much as drink our
good healths?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! I will, indeed I will, sir,&rdquo; cried Jan.&nbsp; He had
taken a good deal of medicine during his illness, and he had learned
the art of gulping.&nbsp; He emptied the little tumbler into his mouth,
and swallowed the contents at a gulp.<br>
<br>
They choked him, but that was nothing.&nbsp; Then he felt as if something
seized him in the inside of every limb.&nbsp; After he lost the power
of moving, he could hear, and he heard the Cheap Jack say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
go in for the Young Prodigy; genteel from the first; only, if we goes
among the nobs, he may be recognized.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a rum-looking
beggar.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go a drinking every penny he earns,&rdquo;
said Sal, pointedly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll soon get enough in a common
line to take us to Ameriky, and he&rsquo;ll be safe enough there.&rdquo;&nbsp;
On this Jan thought that he made a most desperate struggle and remonstrance.&nbsp;
But in reality his lips never moved from their rigidity, and he only
rolled his head upon his shoulder.&nbsp; After which he remembered no
more.<br>
<br>

<br>
CHAPTER XXXI.<br>
<br>
SCREEVING. - AN OLD SONG. - MR. FORD&rsquo;S CLIENT. - THE PENNY GAFF.
- JAN RUNS AWAY.<br>
<br>
There was a large crowd, but large crowds gather quickly in London from
small causes.&nbsp; It was in an out-of-the-way spot too, and the police
had not yet tried to disperse it.<br>
<br>
The crowd was gathered round a street-artist who was &ldquo;screeving,&rdquo;
or drawing pictures on the pavement in colored chalks.&nbsp; A good
many men have followed the trade in London with some success, but this
artist was a wan, meagre-looking child.&nbsp; It was Jan.&nbsp; He drew
with extraordinary rapidity; not with the rapidity of slovenliness,
but with the rapidity of a genius in the choice of what Ruskin calls
&ldquo;fateful lines.&rdquo;&nbsp; At his back stood the hunchback,
who &ldquo;pattered&rdquo; in description of the drawings as glibly
as he used to &ldquo;puff&rdquo; his own wares as a Cheap Jack.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Cats on the roof of a &rsquo;ouse.&nbsp; Look at &rsquo;em, ladies
and gentlemen; and from their harched backs to their tails and whiskers,
and the moon a-shining in the sky, you&rsquo;ll say they&rsquo;re as
natteral as life.&nbsp; Bo-serve the fierceness in the eye of that black
Tom.&nbsp; The one that&rsquo;s a-coming round the chimney-pot is a
Sandy; yellow ochre in the body, and the markings in red.&nbsp; There
isn&rsquo;t a harpist living could do &rsquo;em better, though I says
it that&rsquo;s the lad&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The cats were very popular, and so were the Prize Pig, Playful Porkers,
Sow and her Little Ones, as exhibited by the Cheap Jack.&nbsp; But the
prime favorite was &ldquo;The Faithful Friend,&rdquo; consisting of
sketches of Rufus in various attitudes, including a last sleep on the
grave of a supposititious master, which Jan drew with a heart that ached
as if it must break.<br>
<br>
It was growing dark, but the exhibition had been so successful that
day, and the crowd was still so large, that the hunchback was loath
to desist.&nbsp; At a sign from him, Jan put his colored chalks into
a little pouch in front of him, and drew in powerful chiaroscuro with
soft black chalk and whitening.&nbsp; These sketches were visible for
some time, and the interest of the crowd did not abate.<br>
<br>
Suddenly a flush came over Jan&rsquo;s wan cheeks.&nbsp; A baker who
had paused for a moment to look, and then passed on, was singing as
he went, and the song and the man&rsquo;s accent were both familiar
to Jan.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The swallow twitters on the barn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rook is cawing on the tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the wood the ring-dove coos&rdquo;
-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, boy?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The peremptory tone of the question turned Jan&rsquo;s attention from
the song, which died away down the street, and looking up he met a pair
of eyes as black as his own, and Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client repeated his
question.&nbsp; On seeing that a &ldquo;swell&rdquo; had paused to look,
the Cheap Jack hurried to Jan&rsquo;s side, and was in time to answer.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;John Smith&rsquo;s his name, sir.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s slow of speech,
my lord, though very quick with his pencil.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not
many artists can beat him, though I says it that shouldn&rsquo;t, being
his father.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> his father?&rdquo; said the gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
is not much like you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He favours his mother more, my lord,&rdquo; said the Cheap Jack;
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s where he gets his talents too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No one ever thought he got &rsquo;em from you, old hump!&rdquo;
said one of the spectators, and there was a roar of laughter from the
bystanders.<br>
<br>
Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client still lingered, though the staring and pushing
of the rude crowd were annoying to him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you really belong to this man?&rdquo; he asked of Jan, and
Jan replied, trembling, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Your son doesn&rsquo;t look as if you treated him very well,&rdquo;
said the gentleman, turning to the Cheap Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take that,
and give him a good supper this evening.&nbsp; He deserves it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As the Cheap Jack stooped for the half crown thrown to him, Mr. Ford&rsquo;s
client gave Jan some pence, saying, &ldquo;You can keep these yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Jan&rsquo;s face, with a look of gratitude upon it, seemed to startle
him afresh, but it was getting dark, and the crowd was closing round
him.&nbsp; Jan had just entertained a wild thought of asking his protection,
when he was gone.<br>
<br>
What the strange gentleman had said about his unlikeness to the Cheap
Jack, and also the thoughts awakened by hearing the old song, gave new
energy to a resolve to which Jan had previously come.&nbsp; He had resolved
to run away.<br>
<br>
Since he awoke from the stupor of the draught which Sal had given him
at the cross-roads, and found himself utterly in the power of the unscrupulous
couple who pretended to be his parents, his life had been miserable
enough.&nbsp; They had never intended to take him back to the mill,
and, since they came to London and he was quite at their mercy, they
had made no pretence of kindness.&nbsp; That they kept him constantly
at work could hardly be counted an evil, for his working hours were
the only ones with happiness in them, except when he dreamed of home.&nbsp;
Not the cold pavement chilling him through his ragged clothes, not the
strange staring and jesting of the rough crowds, not even the hideous
sense of the hunchback&rsquo;s vigilant oversight of him, could destroy
his pleasure in the sense of the daily increasing powers of his fingers,
in which genius seemed to tremble to create.&nbsp; In the few weeks
of his apprenticeship to screeving, Jan had improved more quickly than
he might have done under such teaching as the Squire had been willing
to procure for the village genius.&nbsp; At the peril of floggings from
the Cheap Jack, too many of which had already scarred his thin shoulders,
he ransacked his brains for telling subjects, and forced from his memory
the lines which told most, and told most quickly, of the pathetic look
on Rufus&rsquo;s face, the anger, pleasure, or playfulness of the mill
cats.&nbsp; Perhaps none of us know what might be forced, against our
natural indolence, from the fallow ground of our capabilities in many
lines.&nbsp; The spirit of a popular subject in the fewest possible
strokes was what Jan had to aim at for his daily bread, under peril
of bodily harm hour after hour, for day after day, and his hand gained
a cunning it might never otherwise have learned, and could never unlearn
now.<br>
<br>
In other respects, his learning was altogether of evil.&nbsp; Perhaps
because they wished to reconcile him to his life, perhaps because his
innocent face and uncorrupted character were an annoyance and reproach
to the wicked couple, they encouraged Jan to associate with the boys
of their own and the neighboring courts.<br>
<br>
Many people are sorry to believe that there are a great many wicked
and depraved grown-up people in all large towns, whose habits of vice
are so firm, and whose moral natures are so loose, that their reformation
is practically almost hopeless.&nbsp; But much fewer people realize
the fact that thousands of little children are actively, hideously vicious
and degraded.&nbsp; And yet it is better that this should be remembered
than that, since, though it is more painful, it is more hopeful.&nbsp;
It is hard to reform vicious children, but it is easier than to reform
vicious men and women.<br>
<br>
Little boys and little girls of eight or nine or ten years old, who
are also drunkards, sweaters, thieves, gamblers, liars, and vicious,
made Jan a laughing-stock, because of his simple childlike ways.&nbsp;
They called him &ldquo;green;&rdquo; but, when he made friends with
them by drawing pictures for them, they tried to teach him their own
terrible lore.&nbsp; Once the Cheap Jack gave Jan a penny to go with
some other boys to a penny theatre, or &ldquo;gaff.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
depravity of the entertainment was a light matter to the depravity of
the children by whom the place was crowded, and who had not so much
lost as never found shame.&nbsp; Jan was standing amongst them, when
he caught sight of a boy with a white head leaning over the gallery,
whose face had a curious accidental likeness to Abel&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
The expression was quite different, for this one was partly imbecile,
but there was just likeness enough to recall the past with an unutterable
pang.&nbsp; What would Abel have said to see him there?&nbsp; Jan could
not breathe in the place.&nbsp; The others were engaged, and he fought
his way out.<br>
<br>
What he had heard and seen rang in his ears and danced before his eyes
after he crept to bed, as the dawn broke over the streets.&nbsp; But
as if Abel himself had watched by his bedside as he used to do, and
kept evil visions away, it did not trouble his dreams.&nbsp; He dreamed
of the windmill, and of his foster-mother; of the little wood, and of
Master Swift and Rufus.<br>
<br>
After that night Jan had resolved that, whether Sal were his mother
or not, he would run away.&nbsp; In the strength of his foster-brother&rsquo;s
pious memory he would escape from this evil life.&nbsp; He would beg
his way back to the village, and to the upright, godly old schoolmaster,
or at least die in the country on the road thither.&nbsp; He had not
associated with the ragamuffins of the court without learning a little
of their cunning; and he had waited impatiently for a chance of eluding
the watchfulness of the Cheap Jack.<br>
<br>
But the sound of that song and the meeting with Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client
determined him to wait no longer, but to make a desperate effort for
freedom then and there.&nbsp; The Cheap Jack was collecting the pence,
and Jan had made a few bold black strokes as a beginning of a new sketch,
when he ran up to the Cheap Jack and whispered, &ldquo;Get me a ha&rsquo;perth
of whitening, father, as fast as you can.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an oil-shop
yonder.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;All right, Jan,&rdquo; said the hunchback.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep
&rsquo;em together, my dear, meanwhile.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re doing prime,
and you shall have a sausage for supper.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As the Cheap Jack waddled away for the whitening, Jan said to the lockers-on,
&ldquo;Keep your places, ladies and gentlemen, till I return, and keep
your eyes on the drawing, which is the last of the series,&rdquo; and
ran off down a narrow street, at right angles to the oil-shop.<br>
<br>
The crowd waited patiently for some moments.&nbsp; Then the Cheap Jack
hurried back with the whitening.&nbsp; But Jan returned no more.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXXII.<br>
<br>
THE BAKER. - ON AND ON. - THE CHURCH BELL. - A DIGRESSION. - A FAMILIAR
HYMN. - THE BOYS&rsquo; HOME.<br>
<br>
Jan stopped at last from lack of breath to go on.&nbsp; His feet had
been winged by terror, and he looked back even now with fear to see
the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s misshapen figure in pursuit.&nbsp; He had had
no food for hours, but the pence the dark gentleman had given him were
in his chalk pouch, and he turned into the first baker&rsquo;s shop
he came to to buy a penny loaf.&nbsp; It was a small shop, served by
a pleasant-faced man, who went up and down, humming, whistling, and
singing, -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like tiny pipe of wheaten straw,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wren his little note doth swell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every living thing that flies&rdquo;
-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A penny loaf, please,&rdquo; said Jan, laying down the money,
and the man turned and said, &ldquo;Why, you be the boy that draws on
the pavement!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
For a moment Jan was silent.&nbsp; It presented itself to him as a new
difficulty, that he was likely to be recognized.&nbsp; There was a flour
barrel by the counter, and as he pondered he began mechanically to sift
the flour through his finger and thumb.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You be used to flour seemingly,&rdquo; said the baker, smiling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Was &rsquo;ee ever in a mill? &rsquo;ee seems to have a miller&rsquo;s
thumb.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In a few minutes Jan had told his story, and had learned, with amazement
and delight, that the baker had not only been a windmiller&rsquo;s man,
but had worked in Master Lake&rsquo;s tower mill.&nbsp; He was, in fact,
the man who had helped George the very night that Jan arrived.&nbsp;
But he confirmed the fact that it was Sal who brought Jan, by his account
of her, and he seemed to think that she was probably his mother.&nbsp;
He was very kind.&nbsp; He refused to take payment for the loaf, and
went, humming, whistling, and singing, away to get Jan some bacon to
eat with it.<br>
<br>
When he was alone, Jan&rsquo;s hand went back to the flour, and he sifted
and thought.&nbsp; The baker was kind, but he had said that &ldquo;it
was an ackerd thing for a boy to quarrel with&rsquo;s parents.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Jan felt that he expected him to go home.&nbsp; Perhaps at this moment
the baker had gone, with the best intentions, to fetch the Cheap Jack,
and bring about a family reunion.&nbsp; Terror had become an abiding
state of Jan&rsquo;s mind, and it seized him afresh, like a palsy.&nbsp;
He left the penny on the counter, and shook the flour-dust from his
fingers, and, stealing with side glances of dread into the street, he
sped away once more.<br>
<br>
He had no knowledge of localities.&nbsp; He ran &ldquo;on and on,&rdquo;
as people do in fairy tales.&nbsp; Sometimes he rested on a doorstep,
sometimes he hid in a shutter box or under an archway.&nbsp; He had
learned to avoid the police, and he moved quickly from one dark corner
to another with a hunted look in his black eyes.&nbsp; Late in the night
he found a heap of straw near a warehouse, on which he lay down and
fell asleep.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock the next morning he was awakened
by the clanging of a bell, and he jumped up in time to avoid a porter
who was coming to the warehouse, and ran &ldquo;on and on.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was a bright morning, and the sun was shining; but Jan&rsquo;s feet
were sore, and his bones ached from cold and weariness.&nbsp; Yesterday
the struggle to escape the Cheap Jack had kept him up, but now he could
only feel his utter loneliness and misery.&nbsp; There was not a friendly
sound in all the noises of the great city, - the street cries of food
he could not buy, the quarrelling, the laughter with which he had no
concern, the tramp of strange feet, the roar of traffic and prosperity
in which he had no part.<br>
<br>
He was so lonely, so desolate, that when a sound came to him which was
familiar and pleasant, and full of old and good and happy associations,
it seemed to bring his sad life to a climax, to give just one strain
too much to his powers of endurance.&nbsp; Like the white lights he
put to his black sketches, it seemed to bring the darkness of his life
into relief, and he felt as if he could bear no more, and would like
to sit down and die.&nbsp; The sound came through the porch of a church.&nbsp;
It was the singing of a hymn, - one of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns,
of which Master Swift was so fond.<br>
<br>
The sooty iron gates were open, and so was the door.&nbsp; Jan crept
in to peep, and he caught sight of a stained window full of pale faces,
which seemed to beckon him, and he went into the church and no one molested
him.<br>
<br>
There is a very popular bit of what I venture to think a partly false
philosophy which comes up again and again in magazines and story books
in the shape of satirical contrasts between the words of the General
Confession, or the Litany, and the particular materials in which the
worshippers, the intercessors, and the confessing sinners happen to
be clothed.&nbsp; But, since broadcloth has never yet been made stout
enough to keep temptation from the soul, and silk has proved no protection
against sorrow, I confess that I never could see any thing more incongruous
in the confessions and petitions of handsomely dressed people than of
ragged ones.&nbsp; That any sinner can be &ldquo;miserable&rdquo; in
satin, seems impossible, or at least offensive, to some minds; perhaps
to those who know least of the reckless, callous light-heartedness of
the most ragged reprobates.<br>
<br>
This has nothing to do, it seems to me, with the fact that a certain
degree of outlay on dress is criminal, on several grave accounts; nor
even with the incongruous spectacle of a becoming bonnet arranged during
the Litany by the tightly gloved fingers of a worshipper, who would
probably not be any the more devout for being uncomfortably conscious
of bad clothes.&nbsp; An old friend of my childhood used to tell me
that she always thought a good deal of her dress before going to church,
that she might quite forget it when there.<br>
<br>
Surely, dress has absolutely nothing to do with devotion.&nbsp; And
the impertinent patronage of worshippers in &ldquo;fustian&rdquo; is
at least as offensive as the older-fashioned vulgarity of pride in congregations
who &ldquo;come in their own carriages.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I do protest
against the flippant inference that good clothes for the body must lower
the assumptions of the spirit, or make repentance insincere; which I
no more believe than that the worship of a clean Christian is less acceptable
than that of a brother who cannot afford or does not value the use of
soap.<br>
<br>
I am perhaps anxious to defend this congregation, on which Jan stumbled
in the pale light of early morning in the city, from any imputation
on the sincerity of its worship, because it was mostly very comfortably
clad.&nbsp; The men were chiefly business men, with a good deal of the
obnoxious &ldquo;broadcloth&rdquo; about them, and with well-brushed
hats beneath their seats.&nbsp; One of the stoutest and most comfortable-looking,
with an intelligent face and a fair clean complexion which spoke of
good food, stood near the door.&nbsp; He wore a new great-coat with
a velvet collar, but his gray eyes (they had seen middle age, and did
not shine with any flash of youthful enthusiasm) were fixed upon the
window, and he sang very heartily, and by heart, -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Other Refuge have I none!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave, ah! leave me not alone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still support and comfort me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The tears flowed down Jan&rsquo;s cheeks.&nbsp; It had been a favorite
hymn of his foster-mother, and he had often sung it to her.&nbsp; Master
Swift used to &ldquo;give the note,&rdquo; and then sink himself into
the bass part, and these quaint duets had been common at the mill.&nbsp;
How delightful such simple pleasures seem to those who look back on
them from the dark places of the earth, full of misery and wickedness!<br>
<br>
In spite of his tears, Jan was fain to join as the hymn went on, and
he sang like a bird, -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All my trust on Thee is stayed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my help from Thee I bring;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover my defenceless head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the shadow of Thy wing.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was the hymn after the third collect, and when it was ended the comfortable-looking
gentleman motioned Jan into a seat, and he knelt down.<br>
<br>
When the service was over, the same gentleman took him by the arm, and
asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, my boy?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
A rapid survey of his woes led Jan to reply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no home,
sir.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The congregation had dispersed quickly, for the men were going to business.<br>
<br>
This gentleman walked fast, and he hurried Jan along with him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who are your parents?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; The service had
recalled Jan&rsquo;s highest associations, and he was anxious to tell
the strict truth.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know, sir,&rdquo; said he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; sobbed poor Jan.<br>
<br>
They were stopping before a large house, and the gentleman said, &ldquo;Look
here, my boy.&nbsp; If you had a good home, and good food, and clothes,
would you work?&nbsp; Would you try to be a good lad, and learn an honest
trade?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Have you ever worked?&nbsp; What can you do?&rdquo; asked the
gentleman.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I can mind pigs; but I do think &rsquo;twould be best for I to
be in a mill, and I&rsquo;ve got a miller&rsquo;s thumb.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Jan said this because the idea had struck him that if he could only
get home again he might hire himself out at a mop to Master Lake.&nbsp;
A traditional belief in the force of the law of hiring made him think
that this would protect him against any claim of the Cheap Jack.&nbsp;
Before the gentleman could reply, the house-door was opened by a boy
some years older than Jan, who was despatched to fetch &ldquo;the master.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Jan felt sure that it must be a school, though he was puzzled by the
contents of the room in which they waited.&nbsp; It was filled with
pretty specimens of joiner&rsquo;s and cabinet-maker&rsquo;s work, some
quite and some partly finished.&nbsp; There were also brushes of various
kinds, so that, if there had been a suitable window, Jan would have
concluded that it was a shop.&nbsp; In two or three moments the master&rsquo;s
step sounded in the passage.<br>
<br>
Jan had pleasant associations with the word &ldquo;master,&rdquo; and
he looked up with some vague fancy of seeing a second Master Swift.&nbsp;
Not that Master Swift, or any one else in the slow-going little village,
ever walked with this sharp, hasty tread, as if one hoped to overtake
time!&nbsp; With such a step the gentleman himself went away, when he
had said to Jan, &ldquo;Be a good boy, my lad, and attend to your master,
and he&rsquo;ll be a good friend to you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He was not in the least like Master Swift.&nbsp; He was young, and youthfully
dressed.&nbsp; A schoolmaster with neither spectacles nor a black coat
was a new idea to Jan; but he seemed to be kind, for, with a sharp look
at Jan&rsquo;s pinched face, he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be glad of
some breakfast, my lad, I fancy; and breakfast&rsquo;s only just over.&nbsp;
Come along.&rdquo;&nbsp; And away he went at double quick time down
the passage, and Jan ran after him.<br>
<br>
On their way to the kitchen, they crossed an open court where boys were
playing, and round which ran mottoes in large letters.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You can read?&rdquo; said the master, quickly, as he caught Jan&rsquo;s
eyes following the texts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you ever been to school?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Can you write?&nbsp; What else have you learned?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan pondered his stock of accomplishments.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can write,
sir, and cipher.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve learned geography and history,
and Master Swift gave I lessons in mechanics, and I be very fond of
poetry and painting, and&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
The master was painfully familiar with the inventive and boastful powers
of street boys.&nbsp; He pushed Jan before him into the kitchen, saying
smartly, but good-humoredly, &ldquo;There, there!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
make up stories, my boy.&nbsp; You must learn to speak the truth, if
you come into the Home.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t expect poets and painters,&rdquo;
he added, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you can chop wood, and learn what
you&rsquo;re taught, you&rsquo;ll do for us.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
A smile stole over the face of a shrewd-looking lad who was washing
dishes at the table.&nbsp; Jan saw that he was not believed, and his
tears fell into the mug of cocoa, and on to the bread which formed his
breakfast.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXXIII.<br>
<br>
THE BUSINESS MAN AND THE PAINTER. - PICTURES AND POT BOILERS. - CIMABUE
AND GIOTTO. - THE SALMON-COLORED OMNIBUS.<br>
<br>
The business men were half way to their business when the shadow of
the sooty church still fell upon one or two of the congregation who
dispersed more slowly; a few aged poor who lingered from infirmity as
well as leisure; and a man neither very old nor very poor, whose strong
limbs did not bear him away at a much quicker pace.&nbsp; His enjoyment
of the peculiar pleasures of an early walk was deliberate as well as
full, and bustle formed no necessary part of his trade.&nbsp; He was
a painter.<br>
<br>
The business gentleman hurrying out of the Boys&rsquo; Home stumbled
against the painter, whom he knew, but whom just now he would not have
been sorry to avoid.&nbsp; The very next salmon-colored omnibus that
passed the end of the street would only just enable him to be punctual
if he could catch it, and the painter, in his opinion, had &ldquo;no
sense of the value of time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The painter, on the other hand,
held as strong a conviction that his friend&rsquo;s sense of the monetary
value of time was so exaggerated as to hinder his sense of many higher
things in this beautiful world.&nbsp; But they were fast friends nevertheless,
and with equal charity pitied each other respectively for a slovenly
and a slavish way of life.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My dear friend!&rdquo; cried the artist, seizing the other by
the elbow, &ldquo;you are just coming from where I was thinking of going.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;By all means, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Jan&rsquo;s friend,
shaking hands to release his elbow, &ldquo;the master will be delighted,
and - my time is not my own, you know.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I know well,&rdquo; said the artist, with a little humorous malice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It belongs to others.&nbsp; That is your benevolence.&nbsp; So&rdquo;
-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; laughed the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not a man of leisure like you.&nbsp; I must catch the next salmon-colored
omnibus.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk with you to it, and talk as we go.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t propose to run at your time of life, and with your position
in the city!&nbsp; Now tell me, my good friend, the boys in your Home
are the offscouring of the streets, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They are mostly destitute lads, but they have never been convicted
of crime any more than yourself.&nbsp; It is the fundamental distinction
between our Home and other industrial schools.&nbsp; Our effort is to
save boys whom destitution has <i>all but</i> made criminal.&nbsp; It
is not a reformatory.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon, I know.&nbsp; But I was speaking of their
bodily condition only.&nbsp; I want a model, and should be glad to get
it without the nuisance of sketching in the slums.&nbsp; Such a ragged,
pinched, eager, and yet stupid child as might sit homeless between the
black walls of Newgate and the churchyard of St. Sepulchre, - a waif
of the richest and most benevolent society in Christendom, for whom
the alternative of the churchyard would be the better.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not the only one, I trust,&rdquo; said the business gentleman,
almost passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;I trust in GOD, not the only alternative.&nbsp;
If I have a hope, it is that of greater and more effective efforts than
hitherto to rescue the children of London from crime.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In the warmth of this outburst, he had permitted a salmon-colored omnibus
to escape him, but, being much too good a man of business to waste time
in regrets, he placed himself at a convenient point for catching the
next, and went on speaking.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am glad to hear you have another picture in hand.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not a <i>picture</i> - a <i>pot boiler</i>,&rdquo; said the artist,
testily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Low art - domestic sentiment - cheap pathos.&nbsp;
My <i>picture</i> no one would look at, even if it were finished, and
if I could bring myself to part with it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mind, you give me the first refusal.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Of my <i>picture?</i>&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, that is, I mean your street boy.&nbsp; It is just in my
line.&nbsp; I delight in your things.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t make it
too pathetic, or my wife won&rsquo;t be able to bear it in the drawing
room.&nbsp; Your things always make her cry.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the pot boiler,&rdquo; said the artist; &ldquo;I
really wish you&rsquo;d look at my picture, unfinished as it is.&nbsp;
I should like you to have it.&nbsp; Anybody&rsquo;ll take the pot boiler.&nbsp;
I want a model for the picture too, and, oddly enough, a boy; but one
you can&rsquo;t provide me with.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No?&nbsp; The subject you say is&rdquo; - said the man of business,
dreamily, as he strove at the same time to make out if a distant omnibus
were yellow or salmon-colored.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Cimabue finding the boy Giotto drawing on the sand.&nbsp; Ah!
my friend, can one realize that meeting?&nbsp; Can one picture the generous
glow with which the mature and courtly artist recognized unconscious
genius struggling under the form of a shepherd lad, - yearning out of
his great Italian eyes over that glowing landscape whose beauties could
not be written in the sand?&nbsp; Will the golden age of the arts ever
return?&nbsp; We are hardly moving towards it, I fear.&nbsp; For I have
found a model for my Cimabue, - an artist too, and a true one; but no
boy Giotto!&nbsp; Still I should like you to see it.&nbsp; I flatter
myself the coloring&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Salmon,&rdquo; said the man of business, briskly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
thought it was yellow.&nbsp; My dear fellow - <i>Hi!</i> - take as many
boys as you like - <i>To the City!</i>&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The conductor of the salmon-colored omnibus touched his bell, and the
painter was left alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXXIV.<br>
<br>
A CHOICE OF VOCATIONS. - RECREATION HOUR. - THE BOW LEGGED BOY. - DRAWING
BY HEART. - GIOTTO.<br>
<br>
Jan found favor with his new friends.&nbsp; The master&rsquo;s sharp
eyes noted that the prescribed ablutions seemed both pleasant and familiar
to the new boy, and the superintendent of the wood-chopping department
expressed his opinion that Jan&rsquo;s intelligence and dexterity were
wasted among the fagots, and that his vocation was to be a brushmaker
at least, if not a joiner.<br>
<br>
Of such trades as were open to him in the Home Jan inclined to cabinet-making.&nbsp;
It must be amusing to dab little bunches of bristles so deftly into
little holes with hot pitch as to produce a hearth-brush, but as a life-work
it does not satisfy ambition.&nbsp; For boot-making he felt no fancy,
and the tailor&rsquo;s shop had a dash of corduroy and closeness in
the atmosphere not grateful to nostrils so long refreshed by the breezes
of the plains.&nbsp; But, when an elder boy led him into the airy room
of the cabinet-maker, Jan found a subject of interest.&nbsp; The man
was making a piece of furniture to order; the boys had done the rough
work, and he was finishing it.&nbsp; It was a combination of shelves
and cupboard, and was something like an old oak cabinet which stood
in Master Chuter&rsquo;s parlor, and which, in Jan&rsquo;s opinion,
was both handsomer and more convenient than this.&nbsp; When the joiner,
amused by the keen gaze of Jan&rsquo;s black eyes, asked him good-naturedly
&ldquo;how he liked it,&rdquo; Jan expressed his opinion, to illustrate
which he involuntarily took up the fat pencil lying on the bench, and
made a sketch of Master Chuter&rsquo;s cabinet upon a bit of wood.<br>
<br>
News spreads with mysterious swiftness in all communities, large and
small.&nbsp; Before dinner-time, it was known throughout the Home that
the master joiner had applied for the new boy as a pupil, and that he
could draw with a black-lead pencil, and set his betters to rights.<br>
<br>
The master had passed through several phases of feeling over Jan during
that morning.&nbsp; His first impression had been dispelled by Jan&rsquo;s
orderly ways, and the absence of any vagrant restlessness about him.&nbsp;
The joiner&rsquo;s report awoke a hope that he would become a star of
the institution, but as his acquirements came to the light, and he proved
not merely to have a good voice, but to have been in a choir, the master&rsquo;s
generous hopes received a check, and as the day passed on he became
more and more convinced that it was a case to be &ldquo;restored to
his friends.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
When two o&rsquo;clock came, and the boys were all out for &ldquo;recreation,&rdquo;
Jan had to endure some chaff on the subject of his accomplishments.&nbsp;
But the banter of London street boys was familiar to him, and he took
it in good part.&nbsp; When they found him good-tempered, he was soon
popular, and they asked his history with friendly curiosity.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And vot sort of a mansion did you hang out in ven you wos at
home?&rdquo; inquired a little lad, whose rosy cheeks and dancing eyes
would have qualified him to sit as a model for the hero of some little
tale of rustic life and simplicity, but who had graduated in the lowest
lore of the streets so much before he was properly able to walk that
he was bandy-legged in consequence.&nbsp; There must have been some
blood in him that was domestic and not vagrant in its currents, for
he was as a rule one of the steadiest and best-behaved boys in the establishment.&nbsp;
Only from time to time he burst out into street slang of the strongest
description, apparently as a relief to his feelings.&nbsp; Happily for
the cause it had at heart, the Boys&rsquo; Home was guided by large-minded
counsels, and if the eyes of the master were as the eyes of Argus, they
could also wink on occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hout with it!&rdquo; said
the bow-legged boy, straddling before Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it wos Buckingham
Palace as you resided in, make a clean breast of it, and hease your
mind.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thee knows more of palaces than the likes of me.&nbsp; Thee manners
be so fine,&rdquo; said Jan; and the repartee drew a roar of laughter,
in which the bandy-legged boy joined.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve lived
in a windmill,&rdquo; Jan added, &ldquo;and that be more than thee&rsquo;ve
done, I fancy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Some of the boys had seen windmills, and some had not; and there was
a strong tendency among the boys who had to give exaggerated, not to
say totally fictitious, descriptions of those buildings to the boys
who had not.&nbsp; There was a quick, prevailing impression, however,
that Jan&rsquo;s word could be trusted, and he was appealed to.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take it off in a picter,&rdquo; said the bandy-legged boy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We heered as you took off a <i>sweet of furnitur</i> in the Master&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; Take off the windmill, if you lived in it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
There was a bit of chalk in Jan&rsquo;s pocket, and the courtyard was
paved.&nbsp; He knelt down, and the boys gathered round him.&nbsp; They
were sharp enough to be sympathetic, and when he begged them to be quiet
they kept a breathless silence, which was broken only by the distant
roar of London outside, and by the Master&rsquo;s voice speaking in
an adjoining passage.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I can hardly say, sir, that I <i>fear</i>, but I think you&rsquo;ll
find most of them look too hearty and comfortable for your purpose.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
About Jan the silence was breathless.&nbsp; The bow-legged boy literally
laid his hand upon his mouth, and he had better have laid it over his
eyes, for they seemed in danger of falling out of their sockets.<br>
<br>
Jan covered his for a moment, and then looked upwards.&nbsp; Back upon
his sensitive memory rolled the past, like a returning tide which sweeps
every thing before it.&nbsp; Much clearer than those roofs and chimney-stacks
the windmill stood against the sky, with arms outstretched as if to
recall its truant son.&nbsp; If he had needed it to draw from, it was
there, plain enough.&nbsp; But how should he need to see it, on whose
heart every line of it was written?&nbsp; He could have laid his hand
in the dark upon the bricks that were weather-stained into fanciful
landscapes upon its walls, and planted his feet on the spot where the
grass was most worn down about its base.<br>
<br>
He drew with such power and rapidity that only some awe of the look
upon his face could have kept silence in the little crowd whom he had
forgotten.&nbsp; And when the last scrap of chalk had crumbled, and
he dragged his blackened finger over the foreground till it bled, the
voice which broke the silence was the voice of a stranger, who stood
with the master on the threshold of the court-yard.<br>
<br>
Never perhaps was more conveyed in one word than in that which he spoke,
though its meaning was known to himself alone, -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;GIOTTO!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXXV.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;WITHOUT CHARACTER?&rdquo; - THE WIDOW. - THE BOW-LEGGED BOY TAKES
SERVICE. - STUDIOS AND PAINTERS.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Manage it as you like,&rdquo; the artist had said to the master
of the Boys&rsquo; Home.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lend him, sell him, apprentice
him, give him to me, - whichever you prefer.&nbsp; Say I want a boot-black
- a clothes-brusher - a palette-setter - a bound slave - or an adopted
son, as you please.&nbsp; The boy I must have: in what capacity I get
him is nothing to me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am bound to remind you, sir,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;that
he was picked up in the streets, and has had no training, and earned
no outfit from us.&nbsp; He comes to you without clothes, without character&rdquo;
-<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Without character?&rdquo; cried the artist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heavens
and earth!&nbsp; Did you ever study physiognomy?&nbsp; Do you know any
thing of faces?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is part of my duty to know something of them, sir,&rdquo;
began the master, who was slightly nettled.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, my friend, but send me the boy,
as soon as is consistent with your rules and regulations.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The boy was Jan.&nbsp; The man of business gave his consent, but he
implored his &ldquo;impulsive friend,&rdquo; as he termed the artist,
not to ruin the lad by indulgence, but to keep him in his proper place,
and give him plenty to do.&nbsp; In conformity with this sensible advice,
Jan&rsquo;s first duties in his new home were to clean the painter&rsquo;s
boots when he could find them, shake his velveteen coat when the pockets
were empty, sweep the studio, clean brushes, and go errands.&nbsp; The
artist was an old bachelor, infamously cheated by the rheumatic widow
he had paid to perform the domestic work of his rooms; and when this
afflicted lady gave warning on being asked for hot water at a later
hour than usual, Jan persuaded the artist to enforce her departure,
and took her place.&nbsp; So heavy is the iron weight of custom - when
it takes the form of an elderly and widowed domestic to a single gentleman
- that even Jan&rsquo;s growing influence would not have secured her
dismissal, had not the artist had a particular reason for wishing the
boy&rsquo;s practical talents to be displayed.&nbsp; He suspected his
business friend of distrusting them because of Jan&rsquo;s artistic
genius, and he was proud to boast that he had never known the comfort
of clean rooms and well-cooked food till &ldquo;the boy Giotto&rdquo;
became his housekeeper.<br>
<br>
The work was play to Jan after his slavery to the hunchback, and on
his happiness in living with a painter it is needless to dwell.&nbsp;
For a week or two, the artist was busy with his &ldquo;pot boiler,&rdquo;
and did not pay much attention to his new apprentice, and Jan watched
without disturbing him; so that when he offered to set the painter&rsquo;s
palette, his master regarded his success as an inspiration of genius,
rather than as a result of habits of observation.<br>
<br>
The painter, though clever and ambitious, and with a very pure and very
elegant taste, was no mighty genius himself.&nbsp; The average of public
taste in art is low enough, but in refusing his &ldquo;high art&rdquo;
pictures, and buying his domestic ones, the public was not far wrong.&nbsp;
It must be confessed that he had also a vein of indolence in his nature,
and Jan soon painted most of the pot boilers.&nbsp; Another of his duties
was to sit as a model for the picture.&nbsp; The painter sketched him
again and again, and was never quite satisfied.&nbsp; What the vision
of the windmill had lit up in the depth of his black eyes could not
be recalled to order in the painter&rsquo;s studio.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I tell you what it is,&rdquo; said the artist one day; &ldquo;domestic
servitude is taking the poetry out of you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re getting
fat, Giotto!&nbsp; Understand that from henceforth I forbid you to black
boots or grates, to brush, dust, wash, cook, or whatever disturbs the
peace or hinders the growth of the soul.&nbsp; I must get the widow
back!&rdquo; and the painter heaved a deep sigh.<br>
<br>
But Jan was resolute against the widow.&nbsp; He effected a compromise.&nbsp;
The bandy-legged boy from the Home was taken into the painter&rsquo;s
service, and Jan made himself responsible for his good conduct.&nbsp;
He began by warning his vivacious friend that no freemasonry of common
street-boyhood could hinder the duty he owed to his master of protecting
his property and insuring his comfort, and that he must sooner tell
tales of his friend than have the painter wronged.&nbsp; To this homily
the bandy-legged boy listened with his red cheeks artificially distended,
and occasional murmurs of &ldquo;Crikey!&rdquo; but he took service
on these terms, and did Jan no discredit.&nbsp; He was incorruptibly
honest, and when from time to time the street fever seized him, and
he left his work to play at post-leaping outside, Jan would quietly
take his place, and did not betray him.&nbsp; This kindness invariably
drew tears of penitence from the soft-hearted young vagrant, his freaks
grew rarer and rarer, and he finally became as steady as he was quick-witted.<br>
<br>
Jan&rsquo;s duties were now confined to the painting-room, and he soon
became familiar with the studios of other artists, where his intelligent
admiration of paintings which took his fancy, his modesty, his willing
good-nature, and his precocious talent made him a general favorite.<br>
<br>
He went regularly with his master to the early service in the sooty
little church, in the choir of which he was finally enrolled.&nbsp;
And the man of business kept a friendly eye on him, and gave him many
a piece of sensible and very practical advice, to balance the evils
of an artistic career.<br>
<br>
With the Bohemianism of artist-life Jan was soon as familiar as with
the Bohemianism of the streets.&nbsp; A certain old-fashioned gravity,
which had always been amongst his characteristics, helped him to preserve
both his dignity and modesty in a manner which gave the man of business
great satisfaction.&nbsp; He might easily have been spoiled, but he
was not.&nbsp; He answered respectfully to about a dozen names which
the vagrant fancy of the young painters bestowed upon him: Jan-of-all-work
- Jan Steen - The Flying Dutchman - Crimson Lake - Madder Lake - and
Miller&rsquo;s Thumb.<br>
<br>
But his master called him GIOTTO.<br>
<br>
He was very happy, but the old home haunted him, and he longed bitterly
for some news of his foster-father and the schoolmaster.&nbsp; Whilst
the terror of the Cheap Jack was still oppressing him, he had feared
to open any communication with the past, for fear the wretched couple
who were supposed to be his parents should discover and reclaim him.&nbsp;
But as his nerves recovered their tone, as the horrors of his life as
a screever faded into softer tints, as that boon of poor humanity -
forgetfulness - healed his wounds, and he began to go about the streets
without thinking of the hunchback at every corner, he felt more and
more inclined to risk any thing to know how his old friends fared.&nbsp;
There also grew upon him a conviction that the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s story
was false.&nbsp; He knew enough of art now, and of the value of his
own powers, and of the struggle for livelihoods in London, to see that
it had been a very good speculation to kidnap him.&nbsp; He had serious
doubts whether the cart had been driven round by the mill, and whether
Master Lake had refused to let him be awakened from his sleep, and had
said it was, &ldquo;All right, and he hoped the lad would do his duty
to his good parents.&rdquo;&nbsp; He remembered, too, the hunchback&rsquo;s
words when he lay speechless from the drugged liquor, and these raised
a puzzling question: Why should &ldquo;the nobs&rdquo; recognize him?&nbsp;
He had learned what <i>nobs</i> are.&nbsp; Spelt without a &ldquo;k,&rdquo;
they are grand people, and what had grand people to do with Sal&rsquo;s
son?<br>
<br>
One cannot live without sympathy, and Jan confided the complexities
of his history to the bow-legged boy, and the interest they awakened
in this young gentleman could not but be gratifying to his friend.&nbsp;
He kept one eye closed during the story, as if he saw the whole thing
(<i>too</i> clearly) at a glance.&nbsp; He broke the thread of Jan&rsquo;s
narrative by comments which had no obvious bearing on the facts, and,
when it was ended, be gave it as his opinion that certain penny romances
which he named were a joke to it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, my! what a pity we can&rsquo;t employ a detective!&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever knowed a young projidy find his noble
relations without a detective?&nbsp; But never mind, Jan.&nbsp; I knows
their ways.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m up to their dodges.&nbsp; Fust of all, you
makes up your mind deep down in your inside, and then you says nothing
to nobody, but follows it up.&nbsp; Fol-lows it up!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to follow,&rdquo; said Jan; &ldquo;and
how can I make up my mind, when I know nothing?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where it is,&rdquo; said his friend; &ldquo;if
you knowed every thing, wot &rsquo;ud be the use of coming the detective
tip, and making it up in your inside?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The bow-legged boy had made it up in his.&nbsp; He had decided that
Jan was a nobleman in disguise, and that his father was a duke, or a
&ldquo;jook,&rdquo; as he called him.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s active imagination
could not quite resist the influence of this romance, and he lay awake
at night patching together the hunchback&rsquo;s reference to the nobs,
and the incredulous glance of the dark-eyed gentleman who had given
him the half pence, and who was certainly a nob himself.&nbsp; And never
did he leave the house on an errand for the painter that the bow-legged
boy did not burst forth, dish-cloth or dirty boots in hand, from some
unexpected quarter, and adjure him to &ldquo;look out for the jook.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was a lovely afternoon when, by his friend&rsquo;s advice, Jan betook
himself to the Park, that the nobs might have that opportunity of recognizing
him which the wide-mouthed woman had feared.&nbsp; He had washed his
face very clean, and brushed his old jacket with trembling hands, and
the bow-legged boy had tied a spotted scarf, that had been given to
himself by a stableman in the mews opposite, round Jan&rsquo;s neck
in what he called &ldquo;a gent&rsquo;s knot,&rdquo; and the poor child
went to seek his fate with a beating heart.<br>
<br>
There were nobs enough.&nbsp; Round and round they came, in all the
monotony of a not very exhilarating amusement.&nbsp; The crowd was so
great that the carriages crawled rather than drove, and Jan could see
the people well.&nbsp; Many a lovely face, set in a soft frame of delicate
hue, caught his artistic eye, and he watched for and recognized it again.&nbsp;
But only a passing glance of languid curiosity met his eager gaze in
return.&nbsp; Not a nob recognized him.&nbsp; But a policeman looked
at him as if he did, and Jan crept away.<br>
<br>
When he got home, he found household matters at a standstill, for the
bow-legged boy had been tearfully employed in thinking how Jan would
despise his old friends when the &ldquo;jook&rdquo; had acknowledged
him, and he had become a nob.&nbsp; And as Jan set matters to rights,
he resolved that he would not go to the Park again to look for relatives.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXXVI.<br>
<br>
THE MILLER&rsquo;S LETTER. - A NEW POT BOILER SOLD.<br>
<br>
Jan was very happy, and the brief dream of the &ldquo;jook&rdquo; was
over, but his heart clung to his old home.&nbsp; If love and care, if
tenderness in sickness and teaching in health, are parental qualities,
why should he seek another parent than Master Swift?&nbsp; And had he
not a foster-father to whom he was bound by all those filial ties of
up-bringing from infancy, and of a common life, a common trade, and
common joys and sorrows in the past, such as could bind him to no other
father?<br>
<br>
He begged a bit of paper from the painter, and wrote a letter to Master
Lake, which would have done more credit to the schoolmaster&rsquo;s
instructions had it been less blotted with tears.&nbsp; He besought
his foster-father not to betray him to the Cheap Jack, and he inquired
tenderly after the schoolmaster and Rufus.<br>
<br>
The windmiller was no great scholar, as was shown by his reply: -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;MY DEAR JAN,<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Your welcome letter to hand, and I do hope, my dear Jan, It finds
you well as it leave me at present.&nbsp; I be mortal bad with a cough,
and your friends as searched everywhere, and dragged every place for
you, encluding the plains for twenty mile round and down by the watermill.&nbsp;
That Cheap John be no more your vather nor mine, an e&rsquo;d better
not show his dirty vace yearabouts after all he stole.&nbsp; but your
poor mother, she was allus took in by him, but she said with her own
mouth, that woman be no more the child&rsquo;s mother, and never wos
a mother, and your mother knowed wots wot, poor zowl!&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m
glad, my dear Jan, you be doing well in a genteel line, though I did
hope you&rsquo;d take to the mill; but work is slack, and I&rsquo;m
not wot I wos, and I do miss Master Swift.&nbsp; He had a stroke after
you left, and confined to the house, so I will conclude, my dear Jan,
and go down and rejoice his heart to hear you be alive.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
main like to see you, Jan, my dear, and so for sartin would he and all
enquiring friends; and I am till deth your loving vather, or as good,
and I shan&rsquo;t grudge you if so be you finds a better.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;ABEL
LAKE.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;P.S.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d main like to see your vace again, Jan, my
dear.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan sobbed so bitterly in reading the postscript that, after vain attempts
to console him by chaff, the bow-legged boy wept from sympathy.<br>
<br>
As to the painter, the whole letter so caught his capricious fancy that
he was for ever questioning Jan as to the details of his life in that
out-of-the-world district where the purest breath of heaven turned the
sails of the windmill, and where the miller took payment for his work
&ldquo;in kind.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It must be a wonderful spot, Giotto,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and,
if I were richer, just now we&rsquo;d go down together, and paint sunsets,
and see your friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he walked up and down the studio,
revolving his new caprice, whilst Jan tried to think if any thing were
likely to bring money into his master&rsquo;s pocket before long.&nbsp;
Suddenly the artist seized a sketch that was lying near, and, turning
it over, began one on the other side, questioning Jan as he drew.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do old country wives dress in down yonder? - What did you
wear in the mill? - Where does the light come from in a round-house,&rdquo;
etc.<br>
<br>
Presently he flung it to Jan, and, in answer to the boy&rsquo;s cry
of admiration, growled, &ldquo;Ay, ay.&nbsp; You must do what <i>you</i>
can now, for every after-touch of mine will spoil it.&nbsp; There are
hundreds of men, Giotto, whose sketches are good, and their paintings
daubs.&nbsp; But it is only the sketches of great men that sell.&nbsp;
The public likes canvas and linseed oil for its money, where small reputations
are concerned.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The sketch was of a peep into the round-house.&nbsp; Jan, toll-dish
in hand, with a quaint business gravity, was met by a dame who was just
raising her old back after letting down her sack of gleanings, with
garrulous good-humor in her blinking eyes and withered face.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Chiaroscuro good,&rdquo; dictated the painter; &ldquo;execution
sketchy; coloring quiet, to be in keeping with the place and subject,
but pure.&nbsp; You know the scene better than I, so work away, Giotto.&nbsp;
Motto - &rsquo;Will ye pay or toll it, mother?&rsquo;&nbsp; Price twenty-five
guineas.&nbsp; Take it to What&rsquo;s-his-name&rsquo;s, and if it sells
we&rsquo;ll go to Arcadia, Giotto mio!&nbsp; The very thought of those
breezes is as quinine to my languid faculties!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan worked hard at the new &ldquo;pot boiler.&rdquo;&nbsp; The artist
painted the boy&rsquo;s figure himself, and Jan did most of the rest.&nbsp;
The bow-legged boy stooped in a petticoat as a model for the old woman,
murmuring at intervals, &ldquo;Oh, my, here <i>is</i> a game!&rdquo;
and, when the painter had left the room, his grave speculations as to
whether the withered face of the dame were a good likeness of his own
chubby cheeks made Jan laugh till he could hardly hold his palette.&nbsp;
It was done at last, and Jan took it to the picture-dealer&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
The poor boy could hardly keep out of the street where the picture-dealer
lived.&nbsp; One afternoon, as he was hanging about the window, the
business gentleman came by and asked kindly after his welfare.&nbsp;
Jan was half ashamed of the hope with which he told the tale of the
pot boiler.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And you did some of it?&rdquo; said the business gentleman, peering
in through his spectacles.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Only the painting, sir, not the design,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And you want very much to go and see your old home?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; said Jan.<br>
<br>
The business gentleman put his gold spectacles into their case, and
laid his hand on Jan&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not much of
a judge of genius,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but if you have it, and if
you live to make a fortune by it, remember, my boy, that there is no
luxury which money puts in a man&rsquo;s power like the luxury of helping
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; With which he stepped briskly into the picture-dealer&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
And half an hour afterwards Jan burst into the painter&rsquo;s studio,
crying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sold, sir!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sold!&rdquo; shouted the painter, in boyish glee.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hooray!&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s that rascal Bob?&nbsp; Oh, I know!&nbsp; I sent him for
the beer.&nbsp; Giotto, my dear fellow, I have some shooting-boots somewhere,
if you can find them, and a tourist&rsquo;s knapsack, and&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
But Jan had started to find the boots, and the bow-legged boy, who had
overheard the news as he left the house, rushed up the street, with
his head down, crying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sold! it&rsquo;s sold!&rdquo;
and, as he ran, he jostled against a man in a white apron, carrying
a pot of green paint to some area railings.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s sold?&rdquo; said he, testily, as he recovered his
balance.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You a painter, and don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; said the rosy-cheeked
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, my!&nbsp; Wot&rsquo;s sold?&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;m
sold, and <i>it&rsquo;s</i> sold.&nbsp; That walable picter I wos about
to purchase for my mansion in Piccadilly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, feigning
to burst into a torrent of tears, he darted round the corner and into
the public-house.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXXVII.<br>
<br>
SUNSHINE AFTER STORM.<br>
<br>
It had been a wet morning.&nbsp; The heavy rain-clouds rolled over the
plains, hanging on this side above the horizon as if in an instant they
must fall and crush the solid earth, and passing away on that side in
dark, slanting veils of shower; giving to the vast monotony of the wide
field of view that strange interchange of light and shadow, gleam and
gloom, which makes the poetry of the plains.<br>
<br>
The rain had passed.&nbsp; The gray mud of the chalk roads dried up
into white dust almost beneath the travellers&rsquo; feet as they came
out again after temporary shelter; and that brightest, tenderest smile,
with which, on such days, the sun makes evening atonement for his absence,
shone and sparkled, danced and glowed from the windmill to the water-meads.&nbsp;
It reopened the flowers, and drew fragrant answer from the meadow-sweet
and the bay-leaved willow.&nbsp; It made the birds sing, and the ploughboy
whistle, and the old folk toddle into their gardens to smell the herbs.&nbsp;
It cherished silent satisfaction on the bronze face of Rufus resting
on his paws, and lay over Master Swift&rsquo;s wan brow like the aureole
of some austere saint canonized, just on this side the gates of Paradise.<br>
<br>
The simile is not inapt, for the coarse and vigorous features of the
schoolmaster had been refined to that peculiar nobleness which, perhaps,
the sharp tool of suffering - used to its highest ends - can alone produce.&nbsp;
And the smile of patience, like a victor&rsquo;s wreath, lay now where
hot passions and imperious temper had once struggled and been overcome.<br>
<br>
The schoolmaster was paralyzed in his lower limbs, and he sat in a wheel-chair
of his own devising, which he could propel with his own hands.&nbsp;
The agonizing anxiety and suspense which followed Jan&rsquo;s disappearance
had broken him down, and this was the end.&nbsp; Rufus was still his
only housekeeper, but a woman from the village came in to give him necessary
help.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And it be &rsquo;most like waiting upon a angel,&rdquo; said
she.<br>
<br>
This woman had gone for the night, and Master Swift sat in his invalid
chair in the little porch, where he could touch the convolvulus bells
with his hand, and see what some old pupil of his had done towards &ldquo;righting
up&rdquo; the garden.&nbsp; It was an instance of that hardly earned
grace of patience in him that he did not vex himself to see how sorely
the garden suffered by his helplessness.<br>
<br>
Not without cause was the evening smile of sunlight reflected on Master
Swift&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; Between the fingers of a hand lying on his
lap lay Jan&rsquo;s letter to announce that he and the artist were coming
to the cottage, and in intervals of reading and re-reading it the schoolmaster
spouted poetry, and Rufus wagged a sedately sympathetic tail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How fresh, O Lord, how sweet and
clean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are Thy returns! even
as the flowers in spring;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which, besides their own demean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late past frosts
tributes of pleasure bring.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grief
melts away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
snow in May,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if there were no
such cold thing.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And, waving his hand after the old manner towards the glowing water-meadows,
he went on with increasing emphasis: -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who would have thought my shrivelled
heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could have recovered
greennesse?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Perhaps Rufus felt himself bound to answer what had a tone of appeal
in it, or perhaps some strange sympathy, not with Master Swift, began
already to disturb him.&nbsp; He rose and knocked up the hand in which
the letter lay with his long nose, and wandered restlessly about, and
then settled down again with his eyes towards the garden-gate.<br>
<br>
The old man sat still.&nbsp; The evening breeze stirred his white hair,
and he drank in the scents drawn freshly from field and flowers after
the rain, and they were like balm to him.&nbsp; As he sat up, his voice
seemed to recover its old power, and he clasped his hands together over
Jan&rsquo;s letter, and went on: -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And now in age I bud again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so many deaths
I live and write;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once more smell the dew and rain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And relish versing:
O my only Light!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
cannot be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
I am he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whom Thy tempests
fell all night!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
So far Mr. George Herbert; but the poem was never finished, for Rufus
jumped up with a cry, and after standing for a moment with stiffened
limbs, and muffled whines, as if he could not believe his own glaring
yellow eyes, he burst away with tenfold impetus, and dragged, and tore,
and pulled, and all but carried Jan to the schoolmaster&rsquo;s feet.<br>
<br>
And the painter walked away down the garden, and stood looking long
over the water-meadows.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br>
<br>
A PAINTER&rsquo;S EDUCATION. - MASTER CHUTER&rsquo;S PORT. - A FAREWELL
FEAST. - THE SLEEP OF THE JUST.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I hope, Jan,&rdquo; said Master Swift, &ldquo;that the gentleman
will overlook my want of respect towards himself, in consideration of
what it was to me to see your face again.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t distress me by speaking of it, Mr. Swift,&rdquo;
said the painter, taking his hand, and sitting down beside him in the
porch.<br>
<br>
As he returned the artist&rsquo;s friendly grasp, the schoolmaster scanned
his face with some of the old sharpness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I beg you to forgive my freedom.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a rough
man with a rough tongue, which I could never teach to speak the feelings
of my heart; but I humbly thank you, sir, for your goodness to this
boy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very selfish kind of goodness at present, Mr. Swift,
and I fancy some day the obligation of the acquaintance will be on my
side.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jan,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster, &ldquo;take Rufus wi&rsquo;
ye, and run that errand I telled ye.&nbsp; Rufus&rsquo;ll carry your
basket.&rdquo;&nbsp; When they had gone, he turned earnestly to the
painter.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m speaking to ye out of my ignorance and my anxiety.&nbsp;
Ye want the lad to be a painter.&nbsp; Will he be a great painter?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m reminding you of what ye&rsquo;ll know better than me (though
not by yourself, for Jan tells me you&rsquo;re a grand artist), that
a man may have the ambition and the love, and some talent for an art,
and yet be just without that divine spark which the gods withhold.&nbsp;
Sir, GOD forbid that I should undervalue the pure pleasure of even that
little gift; but it&rsquo;s ill for a lad when he has just that much
of an art to keep him from a thrifty trade - and <i>no more</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The painter replied as earnestly as Master Swift had spoken, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Jan&rsquo;s estimate of me is weaker than his judgment in art
is wont to be.&nbsp; I speak to understanding ears, and you will know
that I have some true feeling for my art, when I tell you that I know
enough to know that I shall never be a great painter; and it will help
you to put confidence in my assurance that, if he lives, <i>Jan will</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Deep emotion kept the old man silent.&nbsp; It was a mixed feeling,
- first, intense pride and pleasure, and then a pang of disappointment.&nbsp;
Had he not been the first to see genius in the child?&nbsp; Had he not
built upon him one more ambition for himself, - the ambition of training
the future great man?&nbsp; And now another had taken his office.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You look disappointed,&rdquo; said the artist.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is the vile selfishness in me, sir.&nbsp; I had hoped the
boy&rsquo;s gifts would have been what I could have trained at my own
hearth.&nbsp; It is only one more wilful fancy, once more thwarted.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Selfish I am sure it is not!&rdquo; said the painter, hotly;
&ldquo;and as to such benevolence being thwarted as a sort of punishment
for I don&rsquo;t know what, I believe nothing of the kind.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; said the old man, firmly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m speaking of the Lord&rsquo;s general dealings.&nbsp;
There are tender, gentle souls, I know well, who seem only to grow the
purer and better for having the desire of their eyes granted to them;
but there are others whom, for their own good, the Father of all sees
needful to chasten to the end.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My experience lies in another direction,&rdquo; said the painter,
impetuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;With what awe do you suppose indolent men,
whose easy years of self-indulgent life have been broken by no real
calamity, look upon others on whose heads blow falls after blow, though
their existence is an hourly struggle towards perfection?&nbsp; There
are some stagnant pools whose peace the Angel never disturbs.&nbsp;
Does GOD, who takes pleasure in perfecting the saint and pardoning the
sinner, forget some of us because we are not worth remembering?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He forgets none of us, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster,
&ldquo;and He draws us to Himself at different times, and by different
roads.&nbsp; I wanted to be the child&rsquo;s teacher, but He has chosen
you, and will bless ye in the work.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The painter drove his hands through his bushy hair, and spoke more vehemently
than before.<br>
<br>
<i>&ldquo;I</i> his teacher, and not you?&nbsp; My good friend, I at
least am the better judge of what makes a painter&rsquo;s education.&nbsp;
Is the man who shows a Giotto how to use this brush, or mix that paint,
to be called his teacher?&nbsp; No, not for teaching him, forsooth,
what he would have learned of anybody, everybody, nobody, somehow, anyhow,
or done just as well without.&nbsp; But the man who taught him to work
as a matter of principle, and apart from inclination (a lesson which
not all geniuses learn); the man who fostered the love of Nature in
him, and the spirit of poetry, - qualities without which draughtsmanship
and painting had better not be; the man who by example and precept led
him to find satisfaction in duty done, and happiness in simple pleasures
and domestic affections; the man who so fixed these high and pure lessons
in his mind, at its most susceptible age, that the foulest dens of London
could not corrupt him; the man whose beloved and reverenced face would
rise up in judgment against him if he could ever hereafter degrade his
art to be a pander of vice, or a mere trick of the workshop; - this
man, Master Swift, has been the painter&rsquo;s schoolmaster!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Master Swift was not accustomed to betray emotion, but his nerves were
less strong than they had been, and self-control was more difficult;
and with his horny hands he hid the cheeks down which tears of gratified
pride would force their way.<br>
<br>
He had not found voice to speak, when Rufus appeared at the gate with
one basket, followed by Jan and the little innkeeper with another.&nbsp;
Why Master Chuter had come, and why Jan was looking so particularly
well satisfied, must be explained.<br>
<br>
Whilst the painter was still gazing across the water-meadows, Master
Swift, who was the soul of hospitality, had told Jan where to find a
few shillings in a certain drawer, and had commissioned him to lay these
out in the wherewithal for an evening meal.&nbsp; Jan had had some anxiety
in connection with the duty intrusted to him.&nbsp; Firstly, he well
knew that the few shillings were what the schoolmaster must depend on
for that week&rsquo;s living.&nbsp; Secondly, though it was his old
friend&rsquo;s all, it was a sum very inadequate to provide such a meal
as Jan would have liked to set before the painter.&nbsp; At his age,
children are very sensitive on behalf of their grown-up friends, and
like to maintain the credit of home.&nbsp; The provoking point was that
Jan had plenty of pocket-money, with which he could have supplied deficiencies,
had he dared; for the painter, besides buying him an outfit for the
journey, had liberally rewarded him for his work at the pot boiler.&nbsp;
But Jan knew the pride of Master Swift&rsquo;s heart too well to venture
to add a half penny to his money, or to spend a half penny less than
all.<br>
<br>
It was whilst he was going with an anxious countenance towards the village
shop that Master Chuter met him with open arms.&nbsp; The little innkeeper
was genuinely delighted to see him; and the news of his arrival having
spread, several old friends (including &ldquo;Willum&rdquo; Smith) were
waiting for him, about the yardway of the Heart of Oak.&nbsp; When the
innkeeper discovered Jan&rsquo;s errand, he insisted on packing up a
prime cut of bacon, some new-laid eggs, and a bottle of &ldquo;crusty&rdquo;
old port, such as the squires drank at election dinners, to take to
the schoolmaster.&nbsp; Jan was far too glad of this seasonable addition
to the feast to suggest doubts of its acceptance; indeed, he ventured
on a hint about a possible lack of wine-glasses, which Master Chuter
quickly took, and soon filled up his basket with ancient glasses on
bloated legs, a clean table-cloth, and so forth.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t say any thing about the glasses,&rdquo; suggested
Jan, as they drew near the cottage.<br>
<br>
Master Chuter winked the little eye buried in his fat left cheek.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I knows the schoolmaster, Jan.&nbsp; He be mortal proud; and
I wouldn&rsquo;t offend he, sartinly not, Jan.&nbsp; But Master Swift
and me have seen a deal of each other since you left, and he&rsquo;ve
tasted this port before, when he were so bad, and he&rsquo;ll not take
it amiss from an old friend.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Master Chuter was right.&nbsp; The schoolmaster only thanked him heartily,
and pressed him to remain.&nbsp; But the little innkeeper, bustling
round the table with professional solicitude, declined the invitation.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I be obliged to &rsquo;ee all the same, Master Swift.&nbsp; But
I hope I knows better manners than to intrude on you and Jan just now,
let alone a gentleman on whom I shall have pleasure in waiting at the
Heart of Oak.&nbsp; There be beds, sir, at your service and Jan&rsquo;s,
and well aired they be.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll be proud to show you the
sign, sir, painted by that boy when he were an infant, as I may say.&nbsp;
But I knowed what was in un.&nbsp; Master Swift can bear me witness.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Mark my words,&rsquo; says I, &rsquo;the boy Jan be &rsquo;most
as good as a sign-painter yet.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I do think a will.&nbsp;
But you knows best, sir.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I feel quite convinced that he will,&rdquo; said the painter,
gravely.<br>
<br>
Whilst Master Chuter and the artist thus settled Jan&rsquo;s career,
he cooked the eggs and bacon; and when Master Swift had propelled himself
to the table, and the others (including Rufus) had taken their seats,
the innkeeper drew cork, dusted the bottle-mouth, and filled the fat-legged
wine-glasses; then, throwing a parting glance over the arrangements
of the table, he withdrew.<br>
<br>
Jan&rsquo;s fears for the credit of his home, his anxieties as to the
effect of the frugal living of his old friends upon the more luxurious
taste of his new patron, were very needless.&nbsp; The artist was delighted
with every thing, and when he said that he had never tasted food so
good as the eggs and bacon, or relished any wine like that from the
cellar of the Heart of Oak, he quite believed what he said.&nbsp; In
truth, none should be so easily pleased as the artistic, when they wish
to be so, since if &ldquo;we receive but what we give,&rdquo; and our
happiness in any thing is according to the mind we bring to it, imaginative
people must have an advantage in being able to put so much rose color
into their spectacles.<br>
<br>
Warmed by the good cheer, Master Swift discoursed as vigorously as of
old.&nbsp; With a graphic power of narration, commoner in his class
than in a higher one, he entertained the artist with stories of Jan&rsquo;s
childhood, and gave a vivid picture of his own first sight of him in
the wood.&nbsp; He did not fail to describe the long blue coat, the
pig-switch, and the slate, nor did he omit to quote the lines which
so well described the scene which the child-genius was painting in leaves.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well have I named him Giotto!&rdquo; said the artist; &ldquo;the
shepherd boy drawing on the sand.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If ye&rsquo;d seen the swineherd painting with nature&rsquo;s
own tints,&rdquo; said Master Swift, with a pertinacious adherence to
his own view of things, which had always been characteristic of him,
&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;d have thought he beat the shepherd boy.&nbsp;
Not that I could pretend to be a judge of the painting myself, sir;
what took <i>my</i> mind was the inventive energy of the child.&nbsp;
For maybe fifty men in a hundred do a thing, if you find them the tools,
and show them the way, but not five can make their own materials and
find a way for themselves.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Necessity&rsquo;s the mother of invention,&rdquo; said the painter,
smiling.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So they say, sir,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster, smartly; &ldquo;though,
from my own experience of the shiftlessness of necessitous folk, I&rsquo;ve
been tempted to doubt the truth of the proverb.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The painter laughed, and thought of the widow, as Master Swift added,
&ldquo;Necessity may be the <i>mother</i> of invention, sir, but the
father must have had a good head on his shoulders.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The sun had set, the moon had risen, and the dew mixed with kindred
rain-drops on the schoolmaster&rsquo;s flowers, when Jan and the painter
bade him good-by.&nbsp; For half an hour past it had seemed to the painter
that he was exhausted, and spoke languidly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get up till I come in the morning, Master Swift,&rdquo;
said Jan; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come early and dress you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Rufus walked with them to the gate, and waved his tail as Jan kissed
his soft nose and brow, but then he went back to Master Swift and lay
down at his feet.&nbsp; The old man had refused to have the door shut,
and he propelled his chair to the porch again, and lay looking at the
stars.&nbsp; The moon set, and the night grew cold, so that Rufus tucked
his nose deeper into his fur, but Master Swift did not close the door.<br>
<br>
<br>
The sun was shining brightly when Jan came back in the morning.&nbsp;
It was very early.&nbsp; The convolvulus bells were open, but Rufus
and the schoolmaster still slept.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s footsteps roused
Rufus, who stretched himself and yawned, but Master Swift did not move,
nor answer to Jan&rsquo;s passionate call upon his name.&nbsp; And in
the very peace and beauty of his countenance Jan saw that he was dead.<br>
<br>
But at what hour the silent messenger had come - whether at midnight,
or at cock-crow, or in the morning - there was none to tell.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXXIX.<br>
<br>
GEORGE AGAIN. - THE PAINTER&rsquo;S ADVICE. - &ldquo;HOME BREWED&rdquo;
AT THE HEART OF OAK. - JAN CHANGES THE PAINTER&rsquo;S MIND.<br>
<br>
Master Swift&rsquo;s death was a great shock to the windmiller, who
was himself in frail health; and Jan gave as much time as he could to
cheering his foster-father.<br>
<br>
He had been spending an afternoon at the windmill, and the painter had
been sketching the old church from the water-meadows, when they met
on the little bridge near Dame Datchett&rsquo;s, and strolled together
to the Heart of Oak.&nbsp; Master Chuter met them at the door.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There be a letter for you, Jan,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas
brought by a young varment I knows well.&nbsp; He belongs to them that
keeps a low public at the foot of the hill, and he do be for all the
world like a hudmedud, without the usefulness of un.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
letter was dirty and ill-written enough to correspond to the innkeeper&rsquo;s
account of its origin.&nbsp; Misspellings omitted, it ran thus: -<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;MASTER JAN FORD,<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sir, - If so be you wants to know where you come from, and where
to look for them as belongs to you, come to the public at the foot of
the hill this evening, with a few pounds in your pocket to open the
lips of them as knows.&nbsp; But fair play, mind.&nbsp; Gearge bean&rsquo;t
such a vool as a looks, and cart-horses won&rsquo;t draw it out of un,
if you sets on the police.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you be took in by that
cusnashun old rascal Cheap John.&nbsp; You may hold your head as high
as the Squire yet, if you makes it worth the while of <i>One who knows.</i>&nbsp;
I always was fond of you, Jan, my dear.&nbsp; Keep it dark.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
The painter decided to accept the invitation; but when George Sannel&rsquo;s
face loomed out of the smoke of the dingy little kitchen, all the terrors
of his childhood seemed to awake again in Jan.&nbsp; The face looked
worn and hungry, and alarmed; but it was the face of the miller&rsquo;s
man.&nbsp; In truth, he had deserted from his regiment, and was in hiding;
but of this Jan and his master knew nothing.<br>
<br>
If George&rsquo;s face bore some tokens of change, he seemed otherwise
the same as of old.&nbsp; Cunning and stupidity, distrust and obstinacy,
joined with unscrupulous greed, still marked his loutish attempts to
overreach.&nbsp; Indeed, his surly temper would have brought the conference
to an abrupt end but for the interference of the girl at the inn.&nbsp;
She had written the letter for him, and seemed to take an interest in
his fate which it is hardly likely that he deserved.&nbsp; She acted
as mediator, and the artist was all the more disposed to credit her
assurance that &ldquo;Gearge did know a deal about the young gentleman,
and should tell it all,&rdquo; because her appearance was so very picturesque.&nbsp;
She did good service, when George began to pursue his old policy of
mixing some lies with the truth he told, by calling him to account.&nbsp;
Nor was she daunted by his threatening glances.&nbsp; &ldquo;It be no
manners of use thee looking at me like that, Gearge Sannel,&rdquo; said
she, folding her arms in a defiant attitude, which the painter hastily
committed to memory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I give my word to the
gentleman that he should hear a straight tale?&nbsp; And it be all to
your advantage to tell it.&nbsp; You wants money, and the gentleman
wants the truth.&nbsp; It be no mortal use to you to make up a tale,
beyond annying the gentleman.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Under pressure, therefore, George told all that he knew himself, and
what he had learned from the Cheap Jack&rsquo;s wife, and part of the
purchase-money of the pot boiler was his reward.<br>
<br>
Master Lake confirmed his account of Jan&rsquo;s first coming to the
mill.&nbsp; He took the liveliest interest in his foster-son&rsquo;s
fate, but he thought, with the artist, that there was little &ldquo;satisfaction&rdquo;
to be got out of trying to trace Jan&rsquo;s real parentage.&nbsp; It
was the painter&rsquo;s deliberate opinion, and he impressed it upon
Jan, as they sat together in Master Chuter&rsquo;s parlor.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My dear Giotto, I do hope you are not building much on hopes
of a new home and new relatives.&nbsp; If all we have heard is true,
your mother is dead; and, if your father is not dead too, he has basely
deserted you.&nbsp; You have to make a name, not to seek one; to confer
credit, not to ask for it.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t say this, Giotto,
to make you vain, but to recall your responsibilities, and to dispel
useless dreams.&nbsp; Believe me, my boy, your true mother, the tender
nurse of your infancy, sleeps in the sacred shadow of this dear old
church.&nbsp; It is your part to make her name, and the name of your
respectable foster-father, famous as your own; to render your windmill
as highly celebrated as Rembrandt&rsquo;s, and to hang late laurels
of fame on the grave of your grand old schoolmaster.&nbsp; Ah! my child,
I know well that the ductile artistic nature takes shape very early.&nbsp;
The coloring of childhood stains every painter&rsquo;s canvas who paints
from the heart.&nbsp; You can never call any other place home, Giotto,
but this idyllic corner of the world!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It will be seen that the painter&rsquo;s rose-colored spectacles were
still on his nose.&nbsp; Every thing delighted him.&nbsp; He was never
weary of sketching garrulous patriarchs in snowy smocks under rickety
porches.&nbsp; He said that in an age of criticism it was quite delightful
to hear Daddy Angel say, &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; to every thing; and he
waxed eloquent on the luxury of having only one post a day, and that
one uncertain.&nbsp; But his highest flights of approbation were given
to the home-brewed ale.&nbsp; That pure, refreshing beverage, sound
and strong as a heart of oak should be, which quenched the thirst with
a certain stringency which might hint at sourness to the vulgar palate,
had - so he said - destroyed for ever his contentment with any other
malt liquor.&nbsp; He spoke of Bass and Allsopp as &ldquo;palatable
tonics&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-poisonous medicinal compounds.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And when, with a flourish of hyperbole, he told Master Chuter&rsquo;s
guests that nothing to eat or drink was to be got in London, they took
his word for it; and it was without suspicion of satire that Daddy Angel
said, &ldquo;The gen&rsquo;leman do look pretty middlin&rsquo; hearty
too - con-sid&rsquo;rin&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was evident that the painter had no intention of going away till
the pot boiler fund was exhausted, and Jan was willing enough to abide,
especially as Master Lake had caught cold at the schoolmaster&rsquo;s
funeral, and was grateful for his foster-son&rsquo;s company and care.&nbsp;
Jan was busy in many ways.&nbsp; He was Master Swift&rsquo;s heir; but
the old man&rsquo;s illness had nearly swallowed up his savings, and
Jan&rsquo;s legacy consisted of the books, the furniture, the gardening
tools, and Rufus, who attached himself to his new master with a wistful
affection which seemed to say, &ldquo;You belong to the good old times,
and I know you loved him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Jan moved the schoolmaster&rsquo;s few chattels to the windmill, and
packed the books to take to London.&nbsp; With them he packed the little
old etching that had been bought from the Cheap Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a very good one,&rdquo; said the painter.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s by
an old Dutch artist.&nbsp; You can see a copy in the British Museum.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But it was not in the Museum that Jan first saw a duplicate of his old
favorite.<br>
<br>
He was nailing up this box one afternoon, and humming as he did so,
-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But I alone am left to pine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sit beneath the withy tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For truth and honesty be gone&rdquo;
-<br>
<br>
when the painter came in behind him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stop that doleful strain, Giotto, I beg; you&rsquo;ve been painfully
sentimental the last day or two.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old song they sing about here, sir,&rdquo; said
Jan.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Never mind the song, you&rsquo;ve been doleful yourself, Giotto!&nbsp;
I believe you&rsquo;re dissatisfied that we do not push the search for
your father.&nbsp; Is it money you want, child?&nbsp; Believe me, riches
enough lie between your fingers and your miller&rsquo;s thumb.&nbsp;
Or do you want a more fashionable protector than the old artist?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, no, sir!&rdquo; cried Jan.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never want to leave
you; and it&rsquo;s not money I want, but&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, my boy?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my mother, sir,&rdquo; said Jan, with flushed cheeks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My real mother, I mean.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t desert me, sir;
she died - when I was born.&nbsp; I doubt nobody sees to her grave,
sir.&nbsp; Perhaps there&rsquo;s nobody but me who would.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
do any thing for her now, sir, I know; but it seems as if I hardly did
my duty in not knowing where she lies.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The painter&rsquo;s hands were already deep in his loose pockets, from
which, jumbled up with chalk, india-rubber, bits of wash-leather, cakes
of color, reed pens, a penknife, and some drawing-pins, he brought the
balance of his loose cash, and became absorbed in calculations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is that box ready?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;We start to-morrow,
mind.&nbsp; You are right, and I was wrong; but my wish was to spare
you possible pain.&nbsp; I now think it is your duty to risk the possible
pain.&nbsp; If those rascally creatures who stole you are in London,
the police will find them.&nbsp; Be content, Giotto; you shall stand
by your mother&rsquo;s grave!&rdquo;<br>
<br>

CHAPTER XL.<br>
<br>
D&rsquo;ARCY SEES BOGY. - THE ACADEMY. - THE PAINTER&rsquo;S PICTURE.<br>
<br>
The Ammabys were in London.&nbsp; Amabel preferred the country; but
she bore the town as she bore with many other things that were not quite
to her taste, including painfully short petticoats, and Mademoiselle,
the French governess.&nbsp; She was in the garden of the square one
morning, when D&rsquo;Arcy ran in.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;O Amabel!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re
alone!&nbsp; Whom do you think I&rsquo;ve seen?&nbsp; The boy you called
Bogy.&nbsp; It must be he; I&rsquo;ve looked in the glass, and oh, he
<i>is</i> like me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where did you see him?&rdquo; asked Amabel.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, you know I&rsquo;ve told you I get up very early just now?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; interrupted Amabel,
&ldquo;when you know Mademoiselle won&rsquo;t let me get up till half-past
eight.&nbsp; Oh, I wish we were going home this week!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, Amabel, but do listen.&nbsp; I was down
by the river, and there he was sketching; and oh, so beautifully!&nbsp;
I shall burn all my copies; I can never draw like him.&nbsp; Amabel,
he is <i>awfully</i> like me, and he must be very near my age.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s like what people&rsquo;s twin-brothers are, you know.&nbsp;
I wish he were my twin-brother!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t be your twin-brother,&rdquo; said Amabel, gravely;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s not a gentleman.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s not exactly not a gentleman,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arcy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;However, I asked him if he sent his pictures to the Academy,
and he said no, but his master does, the artist he lives with.&nbsp;
And he told me his master&rsquo;s name, and the number of his pictures;
and I&rsquo;ve brought you a catalogue, and the numbers are 401, 402,
and 403.&nbsp; And we are going to the Academy this afternoon, and I&rsquo;ve
asked mamma to ask Lady Louisa to let you come with us.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t
say any thing about me and the boy, for I don&rsquo;t want it to be
known I have been out early.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At this moment Mademoiselle, who had been looking into the garden from
an upper window, hastened to fetch Amabel indoors.<br>
<br>
It was between three and four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and the
Academy was crowded.&nbsp; The crush was so oppressive that Lady Adelaide
wanted to go away, but D&rsquo;Arcy had expressed a wish to see No.
401, and D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s wishes were law to his father, so he struggled
in search of the picture, and the others followed him.&nbsp; And when
a small crowd that was round it had dispersed, they saw it quite clearly.<br>
<br>
It was the painter&rsquo;s <i>picture</i>.&nbsp; As the other spectators
passed, they spoke of the coloring and the draughtsmanship; of the mellow
glow of sunshine, which, faithful to the richness of southern summers,
carried also a poetical hint of the air of glory in which genius lives
alone.&nbsp; To some the graceful figure of Cimabue was familiar, but
the new group round the picture saw only the shepherd lad.&nbsp; And
if, as the spectators said, his eyes haunted them about the room, what
ghosts must they not have summoned to haunt Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client
as he gazed?<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mais c&rsquo;est Monsieur D&rsquo;Arcy!&rdquo; screamed the French
governess.&nbsp; And Amabel said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bogy; but he&rsquo;s
got no leaves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lady Adelaide was quite composed.&nbsp;
The likeness was very striking, but her maternal eyes saw a thousand
points of difference between the Giotto of the painting and her son.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How very odd!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder who sat
for the Giotto?&nbsp; If he really were the boy Amabel thinks she saw
in the wood, I think her Bogy and the model must both be the same as
a wonderful child Mr. Ammaby was telling me about, who painted the sign
of the inn in his village; but his father was a windmiller called Lake,
and&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mamma! mamma!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Arcy, &ldquo;papa is ill.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The sound of his son&rsquo;s voice recalled Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client
to consciousness; but it was a very partial and confused consciousness.&nbsp;
He heard voices speaking of the heat, the crush, etc., as in a dream.&nbsp;
He was not sure whether he was being carried or led along.&nbsp; The
painting was no longer before him, but it mattered little.&nbsp; The
shepherd boy&rsquo;s eyes were as dark as his own; but that look in
their upward gaze, which stirred every heart, pierced his as it had
moved it years ago from eyes the color of a summer sky.&nbsp; To others
their pathos spoke of yearning genius at war with fortune; but for Mr.
Ford&rsquo;s client they brought back, out of the past, words which
rang more clearly in his ears than the condolences of the crowd, -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember your promise, D&rsquo;Arcy?&nbsp; You will
be quite sure to take me home to bury me?&nbsp; And you will call my
child after my father, - JAN?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XLI.<br>
<br>
THE DETECTIVE. - THE &ldquo;JOOK.&rdquo; - JAN STANDS BY HIS MOTHER&rsquo;S
GRAVE. - HIS AFTER HISTORY.<br>
<br>
As he had resolved, the painter secured the help of the police in tracing
Jan&rsquo;s pedigree.&nbsp; He did not take the bow-legged boy into
his confidence, but that young gentleman recognized the detective officer
when he opened the door for him; and he laid his finger by his snub
nose, with a wink of intense satisfaction.<br>
<br>
On hearing the story, the detective expressed his opinion (founded on
acquaintance with Sal) that George&rsquo;s pocket had been picked by
his companions, and not by chance thieves in the fair; and he finally
proved his sagacity in the guess by bringing the pocket-book and the
letter to the artist.<br>
<br>
With his mother&rsquo;s letter (it had been written at Moerdyk, on her
way to England) before them, Jan and the artist were sitting, when Mr.
Ford&rsquo;s client was announced, and Jan stood face to face with his
father.<br>
<br>
The gentle reader will willingly leave a veil over that meeting, which
the artist felt a generous shame to witness.&nbsp; With less delicacy,
the bow-legged boy had lingered outside the door, but when the studio
rang with a passionate cry, - &ldquo;My son! my son!&rdquo; - he threw
his green baize apron over his head, and crying, &ldquo;The jook!&rdquo;
plunged downwards into the basement, and shed tears of sympathy amongst
the boots and bottles.<br>
<br>
To say that Lady Adelaide forgave the past, and received her husband&rsquo;s
son with kindness, is to do scant justice to the generous affection
which he received from her.&nbsp; With pity for her husband mingled
painful astonishment that he should have trusted her so little; but
if the blow could never be quite repaired, love rarely meets with its
exact equivalent in faith or tenderness, and she did not suffer alone.&nbsp;
She went with Jan and his father to visit Master Lake, and her gracious
thanks to the windmiller for his care of her step-son gave additional
bitterness to her husband&rsquo;s memories of the windmill.<br>
<br>
It was she who first urged that they should go to Holland.&nbsp; Jan&rsquo;s
grandfather was dead, - Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client could make no reparation
there, - but the cousin to whom the old wooden house now belonged gave
Jan many things which had been his mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Amongst these
was a book of sketches by herself, and a collection of etchings by her
great-grandfather, a Dutch artist; and in this collection Jan found
the favorite of his childhood.&nbsp; Did the genius in him really take
its rise in the old artist who etched those willows which he had once
struggled to rival with slate-pencil?<br>
<br>
His mother&rsquo;s sketches were far inferior to his own; but with the
loving and faithful study of nature which they showed, perhaps, too,
with the fact that they were chiefly gathered from homely and homelike
scenes, from level horizons and gray skies, Jan felt a sympathy which
stirred him to the heart.&nbsp; His delight in them touched Lady Adelaide
even more than it moved his father.&nbsp; But then no personal inconvenience
in the past, no long habits of suffering and selfishness, blunted her
sense of the grievous wrong that had been done to her husband&rsquo;s
gifted son.&nbsp; Nor to him alone!&nbsp; It was with her husband&rsquo;s
dead wife that Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s sympathies were keenest, - the
mother, like herself, of an only child.<br>
<br>
Mr. Ford&rsquo;s client went almost unwillingly to his wife&rsquo;s
grave, by the side of which her old father&rsquo;s bones now rested.&nbsp;
But Jan and Lady Adelaide hastened thither, hand in hand, and the painter&rsquo;s
pledge was redeemed.&nbsp; Since the old man died, it had been little
tended, and weeds grew rank where flowers had once been planted.&nbsp;
Jan threw himself on the neglected grave.&nbsp; &ldquo;My poor mother!&rdquo;
he cried, almost bitterly.&nbsp; For a moment the full sense of their
common wrong seemed to overwhelm him, and he shrank even from Lady Adelaide.&nbsp;
But when, kneeling beside him, she bent her face as if the wind that
sighed among the grass stalks could carry her words to ears long dulled
in death, - &ldquo;My <i>poor</i> child!&nbsp; <i>I</i> will be a mother
to your son!&rdquo; - Jan&rsquo;s heart turned back with a gush of gratitude
to his good stepmother.<br>
<br>
He had much reason to be grateful: then, and through many succeeding
years, when her training fitted him to take his place without awkwardness
in society, and her tender care atoned (so she hoped) for the hardships
of the past.<br>
<br>
The brotherly love between Jan and D&rsquo;Arcy was a source of great
comfort to her.&nbsp; Once only was it threatened with estrangement.&nbsp;
It was when they had grown up into young men, and each believed that
he was in love with Amabel.&nbsp; Jan had just prepared to sacrifice
himself (and Amabel) with enthusiasm to his brother, when D&rsquo;Arcy
luckily discovered that he and the playmate of his childhood were not
really suited to each other.&nbsp; It was the case.&nbsp; The conventionalities
of English society in his own rank were part of D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s
very life, but to Amabel they had been made so distasteful in the hands
of Lady Craikshaw that her energetic, straight-forward spirit was in
continual revolt; and it was not the least of Jan&rsquo;s merits in
her eyes that his life had been what it was, that he was so different
from the rest of the people amongst whom she lived, and that the interests
and pleasures which they had in common were such as the world of fashion
could neither give nor take away.<br>
<br>
Withheld from sacrificing his affections to his brother, Jan joined
with his father to cut off the entail of his property.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rsquo;Arcy
is your heir, sir,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope to live well
by my art, and GOD forbid that I should disinherit Lady Adelaide&rsquo;s
son.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
His great gift did indeed bring fortune as well as fame to our hero.<br>
<br>
The Boys&rsquo; Home knows this.&nbsp; It has some generous patrons
(it should have many!), and first amongst them must rank the great painter
who sometimes presides at its annual festival, and is wont on such occasions
pleasantly to speak of himself as &ldquo;an old boy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
More accurately entitled to that character is the bow-legged man-servant
of another artist, - Jan&rsquo;s old master.&nbsp; These two live on
together, and each would find it difficult to say whether pride and
pleasure in the good luck of their old companion, or the never healed
pain of his loss, is the stronger feeling in their kindly hearts.<br>
<br>
Amabel was her father&rsquo;s heir, and in process of time Jan became
the Squire, and went back to spend his life under the skies which inspired
his childhood.&nbsp; But his wife is wont to say that she believes his
true vocation was to be a miller, so strong is the love of windmills
in him, and so proud is he of his Miller&rsquo;s Thumb.<br>
<br>
At one time Mr. Ammaby wished him to take his name and arms, but Jan
decided to keep his own.&nbsp; And it is by this name that Fame writes
him in her roll of painters, and not by that of the old Squires of Ammaby,
nor by the name he bore when he was a Child of the Windmill.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XLII.<br>
<br>
CONCLUSION.<br>
<br>
A south-west wind is blowing over the plains.&nbsp; It drives the &ldquo;messengers&rdquo;
over the sky, and the sails of the windmill, and makes the dead leaves
dance upon the graves.&nbsp; It does much to dispel the evil effects
of the foul smells and noxious gases, which are commoner yet in the
little village than one might suppose.&nbsp; (But it is a long time,
you see, since the fever was here.)&nbsp; It shows the silver lining
of the willow leaves by the little river, and bends the flowers which
grow in one glowing mass - like some gorgeous Eastern carpet - on Master
Swift&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; It rocks Jan&rsquo;s sign in mid-air above
the Heart of Oak, where Master Chuter is waiting upon a newly arrived
guest.<br>
<br>
It is the man of business.&nbsp; Long has he promised to try the breezes
of the plains for what he calls dyspepsia, and the artist calls &ldquo;money-grubbing-on-the-brain,&rdquo;
but he never could find leisure, until a serious attack obliged him
to do so.&nbsp; But at that moment the painter could not leave London,
and he is here alone.&nbsp; He has not said that he knows Jan, for it
amuses him to hear the little innkeeper ramble on with anecdotes of
the great painter&rsquo;s childhood.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This ale is fine,&rdquo; says the man of business.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never can touch beer at home.&nbsp; The painter is married, you say?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ve been married these two year,&rdquo; Master Chuter
replies.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they do say Miss Amabel have been partial
to him from a child.&nbsp; He come down here, sir, soon after his father
took to him, and he draad out Miss Amabel&rsquo;s old white horse for
her; and the butler have told me, sir, that it hangs in the library
now.&nbsp; It be more fit for an inn sign, sartinly, it be, but the
gentry has their whims, sir, and Miss Amabel was a fine young lady.&nbsp;
The Squire&rsquo;s moral image she be; affable and free, quite different
to her ladyship.&nbsp; Coffee, sir?&nbsp; No, sir?&nbsp; Dined, sir?&nbsp;
It be a fine evening, sir, if you&rsquo;d like to see the church.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d be glad to show it you, myself, sir.&nbsp; Old Solomon have
got the key.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In the main street of the village even the man of business strolls.&nbsp;
There is no hurrying in this atmosphere.&nbsp; It is a matter of time
to find Old Solomon, and of more time to make him hear when he is found,
and of most time for him to find the key when he hears.&nbsp; But time
is not money to the merchant just now, and he watches the western sky
patiently, and is made sleepy by the breeze.&nbsp; When at last they
saunter under the shadow of the gray church tower, his eye is caught
by the mass of color, out of which springs a high cross of white marble,
whose top is just flushed by the setting sun.&nbsp; It is of fine design
and workmanship, and marks the grave where the great man&rsquo;s schoolmaster
sleeps near his wife and child.&nbsp; Hard by, Master Chuter shows the
&ldquo;fever monument,&rdquo; and the names of Master Lake&rsquo;s children.&nbsp;
And then, as Daddy Solomon has fumbled the door open, they pass into
the church.&nbsp; The east end has been restored, the innkeeper says,
by the Squire, under the advice of his son-in-law.<br>
<br>
And then they turn to look at the west window, - the new window, the
boast of the parish, - at which even old Solomon strains his withered
eyes with a sense of pride.&nbsp; The man of business stands where Jan
used to sit.&nbsp; The unchanged faces look down on him from the old
window.&nbsp; But it is not the old window that he looks at, it is the
new one.&nbsp; The glory of the setting sun illumines it, and throws
crimson lights from the vesture of the principal figure - like stains
of blood - upon the pavement.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It be the Good Shepherd,&rdquo; Master Chuter explains, but his
guest is silent.&nbsp; The pale-faced, white-haired angels in the upper
lights seem all ablaze, and Old Solomon cannot look at them.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Them sheep be beautiful,&rdquo; whispers the innkeeper; but the
stranger heeds him not.&nbsp; He is reading the inscription: -<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>To
the Glory of GOD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in pious memory of Abel, my dear foster-brother:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I,
who designed this window,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dedicate
it.<br>
<br>

shall gather the lambs into His arms.<br>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the

[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the

          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
